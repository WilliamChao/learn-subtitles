1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,647
For this project you will need to have

2
00:00:01,647 --> 00:00:03,855
downloaded the Stealth project files.

3
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:05,855
You can download them from the downloads area

4
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:07,855
of the tutorials site. The first thing we'll

5
00:00:07,855 --> 00:00:10,110
do is make a new scene. Go to

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,128
File - New Scene, then go to 

7
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:13,883
File - Save Scene As

8
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:16,339
and save it in to the Scenes folder

9
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:19,535
and call it Stealth, with a capital S.

10
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:22,035
Now we need to drag the level geometry into

11
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:24,035
the hierarchy so that it appears

12
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:27,090
in the scene. In the Models folder locate

13
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,776
the model called env.. (short for 'environment')

14
00:00:29,776 --> 00:00:31,358
.. _stealth_static.

15
00:00:31,696 --> 00:00:32,922
It looks like this.

16
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:35,769
Drag and drop this into the hierarchy.

17
00:00:36,385 --> 00:00:39,183
It should be positioned at (0, 0, 0),

18
00:00:39,183 --> 00:00:41,090
the origin of the 3D world.

19
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,711
But if it's not, click the cog on the right

20
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,481
and choose reset.

21
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:48,684
That's almost all of the geometry but there's

22
00:00:48,684 --> 00:00:50,684
one important part missing.

23
00:00:51,403 --> 00:00:54,410
In the Models folder locate prop_battleBus.

24
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,248
It looks like this.

25
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:58,991
Drag and drop this into the hierarchy too.

26
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:01,595
You'll notice that it's not in the right place.

27
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,491
We need to place it into the parking bay

28
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:05,050
in the centre of the map.

29
00:01:05,977 --> 00:01:11,712
Place it at position (-11, 0, 17.5)

30
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:14,816
using the transform component in the Inspector.

31
00:01:14,816 --> 00:01:19,694
Then rotate it by 270 degrees in the Y axis.

32
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:22,189
Your Battle Bus should now look like this.

33
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:24,685
Next we need to add a collision mesh to the scene

34
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,685
to give it a physical presence.

35
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:30,752
So highlight env_stealth_static in the hierarchy

36
00:01:30,752 --> 00:01:32,554
and using the Add Component button

37
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:34,208
on the Inspector go to

38
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,800
Physics and Mesh Collider.

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,432
The mesh we want to use is a separate

40
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,432
simplified version of the scene

41
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:43,519
called env_stealth_collision.

42
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:47,082
When you select it, it should look like this.

43
00:01:48,656 --> 00:01:52,496
Expand the FBX file to reveal the mesh underneath.

44
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:55,539
Then with env_stealth_static selected

45
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:58,473
in the hierarchy, drag the mesh

46
00:01:59,146 --> 00:02:00,843
to the mesh property of the collider.

47
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:03,346
The next thing to deal with is lighting.

48
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:05,346
We're going to use a mixture of baked and 

49
00:02:05,346 --> 00:02:08,120
dynamic light. But before we get started

50
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,315
we need to change some settings in the scene.

51
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:12,315
We're going to start by making the environment

52
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:15,093
static. This tells Unity that this game object

53
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,699
won't move and can therefore be light mapped.

54
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:19,981
Highlight env_stealth_static and

55
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:22,363
prop_battleBus in the hierarchy

56
00:02:22,655 --> 00:02:24,655
and then click the Static checkbox in the 

57
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:26,655
top right of the inspector. You'll then be

58
00:02:26,655 --> 00:02:28,356
asked whether you want child objects of 

59
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,124
what you've selected to be static. 

60
00:02:30,124 --> 00:02:31,778
We do, so choose yes.

61
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:34,462
The environment is made up of two parts

62
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:35,684
the play area

63
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:38,167
and the extents.

64
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:40,702
We're going to set some layers for them

65
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,666
so that they can be effected by lights appropriately.

66
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,166
Open the Environment hierarchy

67
00:02:48,237 --> 00:02:50,400
and select every child object except

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,590
for the extents.

69
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,341
Then also select the prop_battleBus.

70
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:58,338
We'll set these to the layer called

71
00:02:58,338 --> 00:02:59,748
PlayArea.

72
00:03:01,784 --> 00:03:03,784
And again you will be asked if you want to apply

73
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,159
this layer to the child objects, and we do

74
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,481
so choose yes.

75
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:10,720
Finally choose the extents

76
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:14,126
and set it to the layer called Extents

77
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,180
and choose yes when prompted.

78
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,028
For neatness and consistency we've established

79
00:03:20,028 --> 00:03:22,260
a naming convention in this project

80
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,744
and we're going to rename the camera as such.

81
00:03:25,475 --> 00:03:27,475
Change the main camera game object's name

82
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:29,855
to camera_main.

83
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:33,523
We're also going to setup the camera to

84
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:35,292
render with deferred lighting.

85
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:37,886
Under the Rendering Path setting in the

86
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:39,886
camera component

87
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:42,535
choose Deferred Lighting.

88
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:45,163
We also want to change the camera's background

89
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:47,441
colour to black. So under Background

90
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:49,049
click on the colour block 

91
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:51,525
and then drag down to black

92
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:52,950
and close the colour picker.

93
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,777
Finally we want to make sure that the camera

94
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,627
is not trying to render too much

95
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:58,627
so we'll change the far clipping plane

96
00:03:58,627 --> 00:04:00,627
to 100 instead of 1000.

97
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:03,271
This also improves accuracy of rendering.

98
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:05,598
Now we are going to add lights to the scene.

99
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:08,225
The lighting for the scene is time consuming

100
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:10,225
and so we have designed the majority of the

101
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:12,666
lighting and provided it for you as a prefab.

102
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,045
Don't worry, you will learn how to light

103
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,222
what we have left out later. Drag in the 

104
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:19,268
lights_baked prefab from the prefabs folder.

105
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:21,591
and drop it into the hierarchy panel.

106
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,275
If it's not already, ensure that the

107
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:26,563
position is (0, 0, 0).

108
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:30,241
Now when looking at our scene we can choose

109
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:31,918
to show the lighting by clicking on the

110
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:34,736
sun icon at the top of the scene view.

111
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:37,238
And you should also be aware that if you

112
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:40,415
aren't using 3D gizmos then you can toggle

113
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:42,906
using the Gizmos drop down of the right-hand side

114
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:44,272
of the top of the scene view,

115
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:46,561
and you can also scale the gizmos there.

116
00:04:48,274 --> 00:04:50,274
Bare in mind that you'll also see controls

117
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:52,138
for the lights when selecting them.

118
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:54,138
So if you don't want to see all these overlays

119
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:56,138
simply click off them in the hierarchy.

120
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,968
You should also be aware that if the scene

121
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,445
is performing badly whilst working in Unity

122
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:05,445
you can toggle Built-in Lighting off

123
00:05:05,445 --> 00:05:07,793
in the scene view to have it perform

124
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:08,848
a lot more quickly. 

125
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:11,348
And then simply toggle it back on when you want

126
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:12,893
to check your lighting.

127
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,493
To complete the lighting for the scene

128
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:20,296
we need to create some lights for the room

129
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:22,065
that's currently unlit. You'll find it in

130
00:05:22,065 --> 00:05:24,065
the lower right corner of the map.

131
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:25,962
It looks like this.

132
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:27,743
Start by creating a Point light.

133
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,300
Click on the Create button on the hierarchy

134
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,883
and choose Point Light.

135
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,232
Using the translate tool position it within the room.

136
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:42,530
We'll start with the first of three somewhere like this.

137
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:49,596
To keep with our naming convention

138
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:51,715
we'll rename this point light 

139
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:55,013
light_playArea_point.

140
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:56,560
Next we're going to adjust the colour

141
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
of the light to a yellow colour.

142
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
This should feel more like a real light bulb

143
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,743
than white light.

144
00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:04,783
Click the colour block on the light component

145
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:10,796
and then choose a yellow-ish light.

146
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:12,017
Something like that.

147
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:16,779
Note the values that I have in R,G,B and A

148
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,779
whenever you're trying to copy a colour that

149
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,222
I have in a tutorial.

150
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:24,605
Now we'll reduce the range slightly.

151
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:27,105
Currently it looks a little bit intense,

152
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:29,534
so we'll change that down to a value of 8.

153
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:31,742
The last setting we need to change

154
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:33,464
is the Light Mapping setting.

155
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:35,044
We need to make sure that this light is

156
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:37,823
baked only. Otherwise it will be rendered as 

157
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,231
real-time and effect performance.

158
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:44,256
Under Light Mapping change Auto to Baked Only.

159
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:46,256
We're going to have two more lights in this room

160
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:48,256
to make sure it's lit properly.

161
00:06:48,256 --> 00:06:49,564
These lights are going to be the same

162
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:51,380
as the one we've just made so we'll 

163
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,380
duplicate them and place them appropriately

164
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,899
in the room. Select the point light

165
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,337
and either go to Edit - Duplicate or use

166
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:02,773
command-D on Mac or control-D on PC.

167
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:06,223
Now we have two lights in the same location

168
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:08,516
so again we can use the translate tool

169
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:10,516
and drag the Z axis

170
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:12,516
to move it along slightly.

171
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,516
We'll move this one to the centre of the room

172
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:16,638
and duplicate once more

173
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:18,956
and drag this to the end of the room.

174
00:07:19,427 --> 00:07:20,877
If you'd like, play around with the settings

175
00:07:20,877 --> 00:07:22,877
for colour and range to get a lighting

176
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:24,041
that you're more happy with. 

177
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,041
When you're finished, drag and drop these lights

178
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,041
on to the lights_Baked object

179
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,041
to keep them organised in the hierarchy

180
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,348
that we already have.

181
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:35,606
You can then collapse this back up.

182
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:38,046
Next we need to change the render settings.

183
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:41,909
These are found under Edit - Render Settings.

184
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,909
Change them to the values shown here.

185
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:46,642
First we'll enable fog,

186
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:50,338
we will give it a purple colour,

187
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,468
we will change the density to 0.04,

188
00:07:56,968 --> 00:07:58,968
we will set the linear start to 3,

189
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:01,803
the end to 24

190
00:08:01,803 --> 00:08:04,631
and we will set ambient light to black.

191
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:08,164
Next we need to change some of

192
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:10,164
the quality settings. These can be found

193
00:08:10,164 --> 00:08:15,227
under Edit - Project Settings - Quality.

194
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,560
For the purpose of this tutorial project

195
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,454
we recommend choosing Beautiful or Fantastic.

196
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:25,234
But if you find that you suffer from lower 

197
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:27,469
performance you can choose Good.

198
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:29,469
And set the number of Pixel Lights

199
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:31,469
to a minimum of 6.

200
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:35,456
we will be exporting this as a web player

201
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:37,819
or standalone, so remember to set these

202
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:39,819
as the default under those two platforms.

203
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,819
The first column representing web,

204
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:43,819
and the second represents standalone.

205
00:08:45,602 --> 00:08:47,602
Click on the arrow under default

206
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,775
and choose Beautiful for both of these

207
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:53,021
or Good depending on your hardware.

208
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:55,021
Next we come to baking the light map.

209
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,800
Baking the light map is a process of saving

210
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,004
all of our lighting to a texture.

211
00:09:00,694 --> 00:09:02,694
And we do this in the light mapping window.

212
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:05,107
If you don't have your light mapping window

213
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:08,048
open already, go to Window - Light Mapping.

214
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,048
With the light mapping window open click

215
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:12,048
on the Bake tab at the top.

216
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:15,392
Start by setting the mode to directional light maps.

217
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:18,096
For now set the quality to Low.

218
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:20,096
we will do a high quality bake later.

219
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:22,771
Set the number of bounces to 4

220
00:09:23,402 --> 00:09:25,870
set Bounce Boost to 0.5

221
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,832
leaving Intensity at 1.

222
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:32,533
Set the Contrast Threshold to 0.05

223
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:36,638
set Interpolation to 0.25.

224
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:39,736
Set Interpolation Points to 30,

225
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:42,878
Ambient Occlusion to 1.

226
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,078
Max Distance for the ambient occlusion

227
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:49,623
to 0.25, Contrast to 0

228
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:53,886
and at the bottom set Resolution to 30

229
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,886
texels per world unit

230
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,886
and set the Padding to 2.

231
00:09:57,886 --> 00:09:59,886
Whilst this is a lot of detailed setting

232
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:02,339
you can see the Light Mapping documentation

233
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,135
via the link below this video.

234
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:06,135
Now we can bake the scene.

235
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:07,990
Click Bake Scene at the bottom.

236
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,900
This will take a few minutes.

237
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,900
You may wish to pause the video now and

238
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,900
continue once your bake is finished.

239
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,581
Once you've clicked Bake Scene you'll see

240
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:19,921
a progress bar saying Exporting

241
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,921
and then a further progress bar in the bottom

242
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,921
right of the Unity interface.

243
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:32,298
Once your bake is finished you'll see

244
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,880
an assets progress bar as it imports

245
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
textures for the light map that it's created.

246
00:10:42,586 --> 00:10:44,586
Next we need to make a light to dynamically

247
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:46,586
light the player, so that the player can

248
00:10:46,586 --> 00:10:49,861
cast shadows. Create a new directional light

249
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:51,628
game object by going to Create

250
00:10:51,628 --> 00:10:53,628
on the hierarchy panel, and choosing

251
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:56,201
Directional Light. Name the light 

252
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:59,182
light_main_directional.

253
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We want to reference this light in code

254
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
so that we can fade it when the alarm

255
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,696
is going off. This way the alarm light won't

256
00:11:07,696 --> 00:11:09,900
be interfered with. To reference it

257
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,551
we're going to use a tag.

258
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,740
From the inspector

259
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:17,276
choose the tag MainLight

260
00:11:19,322 --> 00:11:20,916
We now want to tweak the settings

261
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,682
for the light slightly.

262
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,110
We want the game to have quite a dark atmosphere

263
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,645
so we will change this light's colour

264
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,205
to a blue-grey colour.

265
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,035
If you want to copy the exact colour we're going to use

266
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:37,898
set the colour to 33, 45, 48.

267
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,071
Close the colour picker.

268
00:11:41,846 --> 00:11:45,190
Now we will set the shadows to Soft Shadows.

269
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:47,978
We're going to tweak the shadow settings 

270
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:51,333
slightly so that the bias is 0.01,

271
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:56,033
Softness is 4 and the Softness Fade is 0.8.

272
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,175
The Bias is a setting that represents how

273
00:11:59,175 --> 00:12:01,465
far from objects the shadow starts.

274
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:03,958
Values that are too low will produce artefacts

275
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,696
and values that are too high will mean that

276
00:12:05,696 --> 00:12:07,430
the objects appear to be hovering.

277
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,787
The softness is how harsh the lines of the

278
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:11,787
shadow are, and the softness fade 

279
00:12:11,787 --> 00:12:13,787
is a measure of how far from the camera

280
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:15,553
soft shadows are drawn.

281
00:12:16,053 --> 00:12:17,417
The last tweak we need to make to the

282
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,768
light component itself is to effect which

283
00:12:19,768 --> 00:12:22,059
layers are on it's Culling Mask.

284
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:24,059
The Culling Mask is a list of layers

285
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,518
the light will effect. We don't need this light

286
00:12:26,518 --> 00:12:28,518
to effect the extents layer

287
00:12:28,518 --> 00:12:30,796
so we will deselect it from the culling mask.

288
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,796
Click on the culling mask drop down

289
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,404
and deselect Extents by clicking on it.

290
00:12:36,283 --> 00:12:38,283
The last change we want to make to this light

291
00:12:38,283 --> 00:12:40,283
is to change it's rotation so that it's

292
00:12:40,283 --> 00:12:42,283
casting a shadow in a more visually

293
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:45,450
pleasing direction. Change the rotation

294
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,270
to 45, 305, 0.

295
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,612
You will now see these shadows in the scene view.

296
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:58,112
Now remember that with a directional light

297
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:00,112
the position is irrelevant, only the

298
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,112
rotation matters. Next we need to make

299
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:04,112
a light that will show red when the alarm

300
00:13:04,112 --> 00:13:05,792
is going off.

301
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,428
This will also be a directional light

302
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:09,428
and will share a lot of the same settings

303
00:13:09,428 --> 00:13:11,428
that we've just done with the main light.

304
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:13,428
So we will simply duplicate this to make

305
00:13:13,428 --> 00:13:14,843
the alarm light. 

306
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:19,085
Select it and do command-D, or control-D on PC

307
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:21,085
or go to Edit - Duplicate.

308
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,896
We will rename this light_alarm_directional.

309
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:31,413
Again we're going to need to reference

310
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:32,891
this game object through code

311
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:35,169
so we're going to tag it. Use the tag

312
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:38,999
drop down menu and choose AlarmLight.

313
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,572
We also want to tweak the settings of this light.

314
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,572
This time our aim is to make an imposing

315
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:47,310
red glow so that the player knows that

316
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,310
they're in trouble. Let's start with

317
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,310
changing the colour to a dark red.

318
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,961
Click on the colour

319
00:13:54,412 --> 00:13:57,819
and choose red, then copy our settings. 

320
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:00,626
70, 0, 0.

321
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:04,039
Then close the colour picker.

322
00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:06,443
Since the alarm won't be on at the start

323
00:14:06,443 --> 00:14:09,857
of the game, set the intensity to 0.

324
00:14:09,857 --> 00:14:12,592
We also want to effect the extents of light.

325
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:14,061
So we need to change our culling mask

326
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,505
back to Everything.

327
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:18,924
Under Culling Mask click the drop down

328
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,317
and choose Everything to reselect the extents.

329
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:24,317
The last thing we want to do with these lights

330
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:26,317
is to change their light mapping settings.

331
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:28,317
We already have a preliminary bake

332
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,114
of the light map but we're going to do a

333
00:14:30,114 --> 00:14:32,114
high quality bake later on.

334
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:33,926
We don't want these lights to be included

335
00:14:33,926 --> 00:14:35,926
in the bake so we're going to change them

336
00:14:35,926 --> 00:14:37,675
to Real Time Only.

337
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:39,410
Highlight both the alarm light and the

338
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,410
main light in the hierarchy

339
00:14:42,537 --> 00:14:45,699
and then set Lightmapping to RealTimeOnly. 

340
00:14:46,797 --> 00:14:48,457
And that's it for this assignment. 

341
00:14:48,457 --> 00:14:50,398
Move on to the next one to start learning

342
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:52,208
how to code the alarm systems.

343
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,030
Remember to save your scene before moving on.

344
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,030
Go to File - Save Scene.
