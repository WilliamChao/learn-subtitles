00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:02,710
The Add Force function is a function

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,378
that's used to start a physics object moving,

3
00:00:05,378 --> 00:00:07,100
or to change the speed or direction

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,085
of it's movement.

5
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,610
The function has one required parameter

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,694
and one optional parameter. The first

7
00:00:12,694 --> 00:00:14,694
parameter is a vector that represents

8
00:00:14,694 --> 00:00:16,694
a direction and magnitude of the force

9
00:00:16,694 --> 00:00:19,092
to be applied. In this example

10
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:21,820
we're using minus transform.forward.

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,223
Remember that transform.forward is a

12
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:26,739
shortcut to the Z axis in local space

13
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:27,867
of the object.

14
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:30,385
We're using the minus symbol here to use the inverse of

15
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:32,385
that direction. We're then multiplying this

16
00:00:32,385 --> 00:00:35,054
by 500. This example uses a MouseDown

17
00:00:35,054 --> 00:00:36,789
function for the object and when we click

18
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:39,522
on the object, in addition to the added force

19
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:41,522
we're enabling gravity on the object.

20
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:43,524
Let's see what this does.

21
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:45,678
This script is applied to the door

22
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,678
in the centre of our blast door prop

23
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:52,878
and when I click - a force is applied

24
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:54,878
in the inverse direction.

25
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:58,138
Because I'm using the MouseDown function

26
00:00:58,138 --> 00:01:00,138
this force is only applied once.

27
00:01:00,138 --> 00:01:02,254
But add force can also be used in fixed

28
00:01:02,254 --> 00:01:04,254
update to apply a constant force.

29
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:06,547
The second parameter is the mode of

30
00:01:06,547 --> 00:01:07,925
force being used.

31
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:10,369
If this is left out it will default

32
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:11,897
to the type Force.

33
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:14,162
This is used for continuous changes

34
00:01:14,162 --> 00:01:15,907
that are effected by mass.

35
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:18,183
Acceleration is for continuous changes

36
00:01:18,183 --> 00:01:20,032
that aren't effected by mass.

37
00:01:20,032 --> 00:01:22,438
Impulse is for an instant change that is

38
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:24,940
effected by mass and Velocity Change

39
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,940
is for an instant change that is not

40
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,442
effected by mass.

41
00:01:28,442 --> 00:01:30,274
You should also keep in mind that forces

42
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:31,991
are dampened by the rigidbody's

43
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,991
drag property, for example, 

44
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:35,991
if drag is increased,

45
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,180
then the force applied will be less effective.

46
00:01:45,177 --> 00:01:47,177
And naturally on the opposing side

47
00:01:47,177 --> 00:01:50,086
if the amount of force is increased

48
00:01:50,086 --> 00:01:52,773
then the force will be more effective.
