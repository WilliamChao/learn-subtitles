1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,921
Let's look at the basic joints in Unity.

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,545
In this example we have fixed joints

3
00:00:05,545 --> 00:00:07,296
and spring joints.

4
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:09,945
This example forms a basic wrecking ball

5
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:11,505
that does this.

6
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:14,667
Firstly the fixed joint. Fixed joints

7
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:16,862
work in a similar way to parenting objects

8
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:18,358
in the hierarchy.

9
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:20,358
The joint simply locks a game object

10
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:22,358
to the point in the world, or to a 

11
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:23,701
connected rigidbody.

12
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:26,282
In this example we simply have placed the

13
00:00:26,282 --> 00:00:28,282
first capsule in the chain up near

14
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:30,657
the ceiling and attached a fixed joint.

15
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:32,266
This locks it in place.

16
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,266
The other parameters of this fixed joint

17
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:36,266
are Break Force and Break Torque.

18
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:38,266
This is the minimum amount of force required

19
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:39,846
to break the joint.

20
00:00:39,846 --> 00:00:41,846
When the joint is broken the game object

21
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:43,846
can once again move freely.

22
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:46,166
The other capsules in the chain have

23
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,929
spring joints. Spring joints work on the 

24
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,929
principle that the game object is trying

25
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:52,929
to reach a target position. The target

26
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:54,929
position that it's trying to reach is the

27
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,929
position that it's set to in the scene view

28
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:58,929
and any rigid bodies that are attached to it

29
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,929
will pull it away from this position

30
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:02,846
on an invisible spring attached

31
00:01:02,846 --> 00:01:04,046
to the anchor point.

32
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:06,256
If the spring joint has a connected rigidbody

33
00:01:06,256 --> 00:01:08,435
then the target point that the spring

34
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,616
is trying to reach is relative to that

35
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:13,172
game object rather than to world space.

36
00:01:13,437 --> 00:01:16,335
So for example, the second capsule here

37
00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:19,639
is trying to reach capsule 1, and capsule 3

38
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:21,639
is trying to reach capsule 2.

39
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:23,639
As these move they will no longer be heading

40
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:25,639
towards the original positions, rather

41
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:27,639
they will be heading towards the anchor 

42
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,053
point of wherever those capsules happen to be.

43
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:32,598
The anchor is the pivot point of the joint.

44
00:01:32,598 --> 00:01:34,598
You should consider it as where the spring is

45
00:01:34,598 --> 00:01:36,237
attached to the game object.

46
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:38,237
This is shown in the scene view by

47
00:01:38,237 --> 00:01:40,237
an orange dot or box.

48
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:42,237
The spring parameter is a measure of how

49
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:44,237
strong the spring is. The higher the 

50
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,248
value the tighter or stronger the 

51
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:48,248
spring becomes. The damper parameter

52
00:01:48,248 --> 00:01:50,248
is how much the joint will slow down

53
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:52,591
under motion. The higher the number, the 

54
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:54,508
less the spring will overshoot.

55
00:01:54,508 --> 00:01:56,661
The min and max distances are for setting

56
00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:58,661
up a sort of dead zone for where the

57
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:00,924
spring isn't active. They effectively restrict

58
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:02,260
the length of the spring.

59
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,260
Similar to the fixed joint, the spring

60
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,032
also has a break force and a break torque,

61
00:02:07,032 --> 00:02:09,032
which you can set to a certain amount in order

62
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:10,879
to find the minimum force required to

63
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,446
break that joint.

64
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:14,628
Finally, Hinge Joints.

65
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:16,628
Hinge joints are ideal for things like 

66
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:18,628
doors and share some properties with

67
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:20,628
spring joints. The axis of the hinge

68
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:22,960
is the one that it rotates around.

69
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,960
In this example our physics door

70
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,389
has the hinge joint attached. The anchor

71
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:29,753
is set to 1 in the X axis,

72
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:31,865
which moves it from it's center to it's edge.

73
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:33,865
Again the joint is represented in 

74
00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:36,813
orange in Unity and you can see a small line

75
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:39,271
showing you where the hinge is currently located.

76
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:41,271
The axis then allows us to specify

77
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:44,489
around which axis the hinge will pivot.

78
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,489
We've set this to the Y axis so it will

79
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:49,435
react like a real hinge with a simple script

80
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,794
we're applying a force to the door

81
00:02:50,794 --> 00:02:52,627
when we click on it, which pushes it

82
00:02:52,627 --> 00:02:54,627
backwards in it's Z axis

83
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:57,634
using the shortcut minus transform.forward.

84
00:02:58,134 --> 00:03:00,134
In the Add Force lesson you may have seen

85
00:03:00,134 --> 00:03:02,875
that this fires the door straight out of the frame.

86
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,054
But now that we have a hinge,

87
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:07,054
when we apply the force to the door

88
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,638
it simply pivots around that point.

89
00:03:09,638 --> 00:03:11,638
and no matter how many times we add force

90
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:13,638
to it, it doesn't break.

91
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:18,044
In a similar manner to our spring joint

92
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:20,561
we can apply spring-like characterises

93
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:23,151
by using the Use Spring checkbox

94
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:26,185
and using the values underneath the spring settings.

95
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:28,449
The other differences between hinge joints

96
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:30,959
and spring joints are motors and limits.

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,236
Motors are for introducing a velocity

98
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:36,002
to your joint, for example a revolving door.

99
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:38,558
The Target Velocity is the velocity the

100
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:40,558
joint is trying to rotate at and the 

101
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:43,651
force is used to try and attain that velocity.

102
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:46,672
If Free Spin is checked then the force will

103
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:48,574
only be used to try and accelerate

104
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:51,137
the joint and not to decelerate it.

105
00:03:51,137 --> 00:03:53,412
Limits can be used if you wish to constrain

106
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:55,412
the motion of your joint, like with the 

107
00:03:55,412 --> 00:03:57,412
normal door. The minimum and maximum

108
00:03:57,412 --> 00:03:59,620
are the angles between which the joint

109
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,355
can move. Min and Max Bounce are the amount

110
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,355
by which the joint will bounce when it reaches

111
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:06,730
one of it's limits. And similar to our 

112
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,730
spring joint, yet again we have break

113
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,464
forces and torques.

114
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:13,576
For example, if we add in a reasonably low

115
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:16,139
number into the break force property,

116
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,139
we can break the door off of the hinge

117
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:20,487
when adding a force. You should note that 

118
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:22,753
when doing this the door doesn't fly directly

119
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:26,267
backwards but is instead pulled away from it's hinge.
