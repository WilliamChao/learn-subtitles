00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Physic Materials are materials that instead

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,300
of effecting the appearance of a game object

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,300
they effect the way that the object reacts

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,300
to the physics engine. Consider the difference

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,760
between how a basketball and a bowling ball

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,760
might bounce. Whilst there is a difference

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,760
in their mass, their surfaces are also

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,130
very different and they react to other

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,130
surfaces very differently. Physic materials

10
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,130
can be created from the Create button

11
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,130
on the project panel.

12
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,890
And they're edited in the inspector to

13
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,030
control how the surface reacts to another

14
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,980
surface. They do this by controlling friction.

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,980
Dynamic Friction is how much friction

16
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,980
exists whilst the object is moving

17
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,100
and Static Friction is how much

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,100
force is required in order to move the

19
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,830
object from a static position.

20
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,260
Bounciness does exactly what it sounds like.

21
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,510
It controls how bouncy the object is.

22
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,950
And the Friction Combine settings control

23
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,780
how they respond to another object

24
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,290
with a certain material. Friction Direction

25
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,290
will allow you to control friction

26
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,780
in a particular axis and the dynamic

27
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,780
and static friction 2 properties

28
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,570
will give you control over those three axes.

29
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,010
In this example we've applied this

30
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,960
particular physic material to our power cube

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,400
and our work bench.

32
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,720
The physic material is applied to the 

33
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,080
collider in any given game object

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,910
and you can see that there's a slot for

35
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,970
material within the collider settings.

36
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
You can see that if I press play,

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,160
it bounces slightly and is also very slippery.

38
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,290
This is because I've used 0 for dynamic 

39
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,870
and static friction, meaning there's nothing

40
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,870
stopping it from slipping around and

41
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,870
I've also made it slightly bouncy.

42
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,370
If I make it very bouncy

43
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,870
then it's going to bounce off of the table.

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,860
And for example if I wanted to restrict

45
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,860
it's movement in a particular axis

46
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,860
so I can see that the X axis is the direction

47
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,300
in which it's sliding, so what I could do

48
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,300
is go back to that material and I'll set

49
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,940
my friction direction of X to 1 and

50
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,940
increase the dynamic friction. I'm going to turn

51
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,670
bounciness back down to a lower number

52
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,670
so that it doesn't bounce off the table.

53
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,470
And you can see that it's slowing to a halt

54
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,830
because of the amount of friction involved there.

55
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,330
So we could make that slightly lower

56
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,610
and you can see it begins to slide.

57
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,130
So hopefully you can see that with

58
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,130
physic materials you can completely control

59
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,580
the surface of an object 

60
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,580
and how it responds to others.
