1
00:00:00,746 --> 00:00:02,486
For this assignment we'll be using the

2
00:00:02,486 --> 00:00:04,417
empty scene in the robot lab.

3
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:06,583
Open the empty scene and then to make

4
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:08,583
sure that we maintain our empty scene

5
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:11,205
go to File - Save Scene As

6
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:14,741
save it in to the Scenes folder

7
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:16,741
and we'll call this Bouncing Ball.

8
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:21,976
As usual Unity takes you straight into the

9
00:00:21,976 --> 00:00:23,976
scene that you've just saved, so we're now

10
00:00:23,976 --> 00:00:25,976
working in the bouncing ball scene.

11
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:27,976
A good first thing to do in Unity is

12
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:30,290
make the classic bouncing ball that you

13
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,026
may have done in other pieces of software.

14
00:00:32,026 --> 00:00:34,247
In the models folder we have some

15
00:00:34,247 --> 00:00:36,247
primitive shapes, such as the spherical

16
00:00:36,247 --> 00:00:38,703
'samoflange' and the cubic

17
00:00:38,703 --> 00:00:40,758
'power cube', as well as a number of other

18
00:00:40,758 --> 00:00:42,758
different assets.

19
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,791
From the models folder, drag and drop

20
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:49,554
the 'prop samoflange' object in to the scene.

21
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:52,043
Remember that you can use the translate tool

22
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:54,043
to select and move it around.

23
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:56,667
This can be done by dragging the handles

24
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:59,943
or by dragging the planes on the object.

25
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,107
You should notice that I'm using the F key

26
00:01:03,107 --> 00:01:05,480
to focus on that object and move the scene

27
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,480
view in to focus on it too.

28
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:10,298
To make sure that our object is lit by our

29
00:01:10,298 --> 00:01:12,298
dynamic lights make sure that the layer

30
00:01:12,298 --> 00:01:15,824
of the samoflange is set to Dynamic Objects.

31
00:01:17,097 --> 00:01:18,518
Now you should see that our object is

32
00:01:18,518 --> 00:01:20,754
nicely lit and in the mesh renderer

33
00:01:20,754 --> 00:01:23,268
we can also check 'Use Light Probes'.

34
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:25,297
Now our object will be properly lit

35
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:26,649
within the scene.

36
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:29,356
Next we'll add a rigidbody component

37
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,135
so click the Add Component button 

38
00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:33,894
on the inspector and go to Physics - 

39
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,394
Rigidbody.

40
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,819
However we can't use a rigidbody

41
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:41,441
without a collider.

42
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:44,821
So let's go to Add Component - Physics -

43
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,387
Sphere Collider. This gives our spherical

44
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:50,050
object a bounding area and if we zoom in

45
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,678
you should see that there's a green outline

46
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,860
going around it. Looking at the rigidbody

47
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,413
you can see that we have

48
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:57,718
properties for mass, drag, etcetera

49
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,050
and also a checkbox for Use Gravity.

50
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:01,983
By default this is checked and that's

51
00:02:01,983 --> 00:02:03,583
exactly what we want to do here as well,

52
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,583
and what we'll also do is effect the kind of

53
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,583
friction that we want this object to have.

54
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,428
By default if I press play now

55
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:13,545
the object will fall to the floor

56
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:15,989
but what we want to do is add in a friction

57
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:17,989
response too. This is handled

58
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:19,836
by the physics material on the collider.

59
00:02:19,836 --> 00:02:22,225
So we're going to make a new physics material

60
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,225
so I'm going to select the Assets folder

61
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:26,670
and then we'll make a folder for this,

62
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,670
so click the Create button and choose Folder

63
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,907
and make a new folder in which to store

64
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:32,907
physic materials.

65
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:36,175
Then because we want to create this 

66
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:38,175
physics material inside that folder

67
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:40,637
select the folder then go back to Create

68
00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:42,753
and choose Physics Material.

69
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:45,280
This creates it inside the folder.

70
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:47,612
And as soon as you create it you can then

71
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:50,342
name it, and you should name it Bouncy.

72
00:02:50,662 --> 00:02:52,662
Because that's what we're going to create - a bouncy ball.

73
00:02:52,662 --> 00:02:54,662
Before setting up this asset I'm going

74
00:02:54,662 --> 00:02:56,524
to apply it to the object so that we don't

75
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:58,802
forget later. So reselect the

76
00:02:58,802 --> 00:03:01,410
prop samoflange and then drag Bouncy

77
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,410
from the project panel and drop it on

78
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,081
to the physic material setting

79
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:07,081
in the component in the inspector.

80
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:12,891
Now reselect the asset in the project panel

81
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:16,234
and we'll take a look at it's settings.

82
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:18,059
You can see here that a key one that we

83
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:20,059
want to play with is Bounciness.

84
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:23,612
And I'm going to set this to 0.8.

85
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:26,761
Now if I press play what you'll see

86
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:30,035
is that it bounces to a halt.

87
00:03:30,397 --> 00:03:33,132
The reason for this is Bounce Combine.

88
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:35,132
Because what this does is average the

89
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,132
friction on the object and the 

90
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:39,577
object that it's colliding with - the floor.

91
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:42,631
So whilst I've set this to 0.8

92
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:44,493
because it's averaging the two, what we're

93
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:46,493
actually getting is 0.4.

94
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:48,744
So what we'll do is set Bounce Combine

95
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:50,744
to maximum. Do that now.

96
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:54,988
Then you can test out again by pressing play.

97
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:57,619
And now that you can see that it has

98
00:03:57,619 --> 00:03:59,619
more bounce to it.

99
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,992
But if we want it to keep bouncing forever

100
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,340
we should set Bounciness to a value of 1.

101
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:09,620
And we're going to make things a bit more

102
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,620
interesting now. With our object

103
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,399
roughly in the middle of the scene

104
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:16,991
reselect it and choose the Translate tool.

105
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,991
Remember you can use W on the keyboard

106
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:20,991
to select that tool at any time.

107
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,181
I'm going to drag it up so that it's a little

108
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,181
high and then from the Models folder

109
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,432
I'm going to locate my bench.

110
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:30,751
So grab PropBenchWork

111
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:33,101
and drag that in to the scene.

112
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:35,891
Yet again I'm going to put it on the dynamic

113
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:37,891
objects layer and I'm going

114
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:39,726
to go in to the mesh renderer and 

115
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:41,726
choose Use Light Probes so that it's

116
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:44,019
nicely lit by our dynamic lights.

117
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:46,019
Then what I'm going to do is add a collider

118
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,019
because we're going to make our samoflange ball

119
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,635
bounce off of the bench.

120
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:52,772
So I'm going to go to Add Component - Physics

121
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:54,772
and nice and simply I'm just going to add

122
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:56,565
a primitive box collider to this.

123
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:59,339
Then hover your mouse over the scene view

124
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:01,339
and press F to focus on the object

125
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:03,339
so that we can see it a little bit closer.

126
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:06,184
Note that at various times I am holding

127
00:05:06,184 --> 00:05:08,184
down the Alt key on the keyboard to orbit

128
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:10,184
around as I drag.

129
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:12,836
Now I'm going to go to the Hand tool,

130
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:16,016
to effectively hide the translate handles

131
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,016
and I'm going to hold down Shift to adjust

132
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:20,016
the boundaries of the collider.

133
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:21,602
The reason I'm doing this

134
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:24,102
is because I don't want it to bounce off

135
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:26,102
of the top of the collider here.

136
00:05:26,102 --> 00:05:28,573
I'd rather it bounced off of the surface.

137
00:05:28,573 --> 00:05:30,866
So all I'm going to do now is hold down Shift

138
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,601
and drag the top one

139
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:35,051
until it's roughly in line with the top of

140
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:37,051
the work bench mesh.

141
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,576
Now what we're going to do is go back

142
00:05:39,576 --> 00:05:40,996
to the Translate tool

143
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,449
and I'm going to drag this upward,

144
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:46,999
something like that.

145
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:49,941
And now what I'm going to do is

146
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,719
tilt it at an angle. So I'm going to go

147
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,204
to my Rotate tool,

148
00:05:53,957 --> 00:05:55,957
which remember is E on the keyboard,

149
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,095
and I'm going to tilt it

150
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,594
something like that.

151
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,237
Then all I'm going to do is switch to

152
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,346
an overhead view, so using the View

153
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:07,235
gizmo in the top right of the scene view

154
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:09,012
click on the green Y axis spoke.

155
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,459
And then I'm going to reselect my

156
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:13,459
spherical prop samoflange

157
00:06:14,995 --> 00:06:16,995
and I'm going to get my view in order

158
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,565
and then I'm going to drag with the 

159
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:22,227
Translate tool until it's over the top.

160
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:24,492
Note that I'm still in a perspective view

161
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:26,616
and if I want to go to an orthographic view

162
00:06:26,616 --> 00:06:28,616
I can click the cube in the middle, like that.

163
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:31,254
So now if I zoom in

164
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:34,253
I can see exactly whether it's over the top.

165
00:06:35,138 --> 00:06:37,138
And I'm going to keep using the Translate tool

166
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:39,156
to position it where I want it.

167
00:06:40,236 --> 00:06:42,236
And remember that we can rotate round

168
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,704
to side-on views as well to ensure that

169
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,704
we're getting it in exactly the right place

170
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:50,700
and keep rotating around until we're happy.

171
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:55,035
Then I'm going to click on the white cube

172
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,035
in the middle of the gizmo to go back

173
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:59,035
to my perspective view.

174
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:03,165
Now all I'm going to do is press play.

175
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,907
And as you can see our samoflange ball

176
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:12,887
keeps bouncing around all over the environment.

177
00:07:13,898 --> 00:07:14,912
And that's it.

178
00:07:15,923 --> 00:07:17,923
Remember to save your scene, and keep

179
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:19,923
experimenting with the different values

180
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:21,661
in the physic material asset to get

181
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:23,255
different effects,

182
00:07:23,255 --> 00:07:25,562
or refer to the Physic Materials lesson

183
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:27,562
for more information.
