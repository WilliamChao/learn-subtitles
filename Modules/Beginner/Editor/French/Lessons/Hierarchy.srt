00:00:01,206 --> 00:00:05,814
The Hierarchy in Unity is a complete list of any object in your open scene.

2
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:08,379
Objects are listed from A to Z order, 

3
00:00:08,379 --> 00:00:11,837
but it is also possible to create hierarchies of objects

4
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:14,326
which are in turn listed in A to Z order.

5
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:20,679
Hierarchies of objects mean that they are grouped, with the top most object being called the Parent Object

6
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:24,718
and the rest being referred to as Children or Child objects.

7
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:33,659
These objects then have their transform values based upon that of their parent object.

8
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:37,559
For example the position of an object when loose in the hierarchy

9
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,342
is based on it's distance from the world origin, or zero point.

10
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:47,470
But when this object is made a child of another object it's position is relative to that of it's parent.

11
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:53,066
In this example the character object is at the origin of the 3D scene,

12
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,045
the position (0, 0, 0).

13
00:00:57,072 --> 00:01:02,482
And there is a cube object at position (5, 1, 5).

14
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,909
But when the character object is made a child of the cube - it's origin, or zero point,

15
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:13,222
is then the position of the parent object, the cube.

16
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:19,305
Now the character's position is said to be (-5, -1, -5).

17
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:25,795
This being the distance from the cube object, it's parent and therefore it's origin position.

18
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:29,566
We can also see that with Pivot Point Rotation enabled

19
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:33,791
the rotation is now based on the parent object

20
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:39,951
rather than rotating around it's own axis.

21
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:49,351
The same then applies to movement,

22
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:53,284
and scaling.

23
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:02,727
And this will apply until that object is no longer a child.

24
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:11,924
Other features of the hierarchy are the Create button

25
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,296
and Search field.

26
00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:18,956
The create button on the hierarchy acts as a mirror of the Game Object - Create Other top menu

27
00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:24,208
and this will allow you to create various different things that you will need to construct your games in Unity.

28
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:28,395
Whilst the search field works in a similar way to the search field in the Scene view,

29
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:31,505
allowing you to narrow down objects using their name.

30
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:34,620
The scene view then reacts by greying out other objects

31
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,466
allowing you to see the object you've searched for more easily.

32
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,498
You can also make use of the modifier T: in order to search for types of object.

33
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:47,062
Type here being considered as one of the objects components.

34
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,207
For example if I search for T:Light

35
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:55,286
there is only one light in my current scene,

36
00:02:55,286 --> 00:02:57,307
one on the end of the players gun.

37
00:02:58,475 --> 00:03:01,859
And if I search for T: Audio Source

38
00:03:03,772 --> 00:03:05,925
I'll be narrowed down to 3 objects,

39
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:10,429
the only ones in the scene that happen to have audio source components attached to them.

40
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:22,251
When searching in this way, the bottom of the hierarchy shows the path to the object that you've found.

41
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:25,136
Damage audio source being the one I have selected,

42
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:29,342
Player being it's parent and Cube being the parent of that object.

43
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:34,861
This means that when cancelling the search you can easily see where your object is.

44
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:42,484
It will also remain selected and the parent objects of that object will be expanded to show where it's located.
