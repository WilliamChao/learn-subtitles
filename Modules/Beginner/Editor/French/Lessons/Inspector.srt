1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,793
The Inspector panel in Unity

2
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:03,793
is a panel for adjusting

3
00:00:03,793 --> 00:00:05,310
settings for any object,

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,492
asset and editor preference.

5
00:00:07,823 --> 00:00:10,554
For objects, the inspector begins with a title,

6
00:00:10,554 --> 00:00:12,807
a check box for you to check if the

7
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:15,248
state of the object will remain static in the game.

8
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:17,821
This means it's a valid candidate for

9
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:20,406
light mapping and navigation mesh baking.

10
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,715
And then the tag and layer drop-downs.

11
00:00:24,114 --> 00:00:26,283
Tags allow you to assign a tag to

12
00:00:26,283 --> 00:00:29,483
one or many objects in order to address them via code.

13
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:32,082
Whilst layers allow you to group objects

14
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:34,252
and apply certain rules to these layers

15
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:36,513
such as lighting or collision rules.

16
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,216
After these elements the inspector then lists

17
00:00:39,216 --> 00:00:41,078
the components attached to an object.

18
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,889
Beginning with the transform,

19
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:46,061
the default position, rotation and scale

20
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:47,082
of your object.

21
00:00:47,703 --> 00:00:49,905
On any component the inspector allows

22
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:51,982
you to adjust fields in various ways.

23
00:00:52,507 --> 00:00:54,507
You can drag over the values,

24
00:00:55,986 --> 00:00:57,986
you can click and retype,

25
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:01,534
or your can choose to reset the values using

26
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:04,119
the cog icon to the right of the component.

27
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:07,861
In addition to the cog there is also a link

28
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:10,073
to the reference material on the component

29
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:11,880
and you can get to this by clicking the

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,245
blue book icon, and this will open the

31
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:16,776
documentation page on this component.

32
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:24,959
A context sensitive panel, the inspector changes

33
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,634
to whatever you have selected,

34
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:28,893
meaning that you can adjust any object

35
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:31,585
and immediately dive in to settings and back.

36
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:49,824
Because Unity makes use of dragging and dropping to assign values

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,518
sometimes you may click on items

38
00:01:51,518 --> 00:01:53,210
that take you to their settings,

39
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,648
rather than the one you wish to apply them to.

40
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,349
And for this reason you can lock the inspector

41
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:00,541
in order to work with a particular item

42
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,514
and then unlock once you are done assigning settings.

43
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,945
For example on this game object I have a script component

44
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:09,410
to which I must assign an array of textures.

45
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,831
But when I select my first texture I want the inspector

46
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:14,469
to remain on my game object,

47
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,843
rather than showing the texture's settings.

48
00:02:17,242 --> 00:02:19,242
I could simply hold down the mouse

49
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:23,845
or I can simply select the object

50
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:27,533
and click on the lock at the top of the inspector.

51
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,120
This way when I select one or many textures

52
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,117
I can then drag and drop without the inspector changing focus.

53
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:47,299
Once I am done with this I simply click the lock again

54
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,646
and I can then select anything that I need to.

55
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:56,727
The inspector also offers a way of finding assets used on objects.

56
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:58,339
For example materials.

57
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:01,158
When clicking on an asset used within a renderer

58
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:04,534
you can see that asset highlighted inside the project panel.

59
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:07,932
It does this by highlighting with a yellow outline.

60
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:11,668
This helps you easily find the assets that your

61
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:13,668
game objects depend upon.

62
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:17,256
In this example we can see an object that has a material

63
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:19,256
assigned to it's renderer.

64
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,089
This particular material is then previewed

65
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:23,727
at the bottom of the inspector

66
00:03:23,727 --> 00:03:27,341
and I can adjust that material directly from here.

67
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:32,083
However, the other two objects that I don't have selected

68
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,956
also use this material, so I must bare in mind that

69
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:36,762
the actual material I am adjusting

70
00:03:36,762 --> 00:03:39,652
is the original material asset inside the project

71
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,570
and not a particular instance of an object

72
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,908
in the same way that I can adjust the scale of this object

73
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:47,894
without adjusting any other objects that

74
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,425
also have a scale value.

75
00:03:50,276 --> 00:03:52,667
Components within the inspector can also be disabled

76
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,591
by clicking the checkbox to the left of their name.

77
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:01,419
And the entire object can be disabled by clicking

78
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:02,981
the checkbox next to it's name

79
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:04,583
at the top of the inspector.

80
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:09,054
When objects are disabled in this way

81
00:04:09,054 --> 00:04:10,800
you'll notice that their name is greyed out

82
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
inside the hierarchy panel.

83
00:04:13,926 --> 00:04:17,343
And that's the basics of the inspector in Unity.
