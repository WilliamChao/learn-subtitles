1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,043
The Game View in Unity is invoked when the Play button is pressed.

2
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:12,322
In this you can play test your game and get an idea

3
00:00:12,322 --> 00:00:14,533
of what the gameplay will be like when it's built.

4
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:21,371
This can be paused and stepped forward at any time

5
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,712
in order to give you more accurate testing.

6
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,124
You can also tweak things whilst you are in play mode

7
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:30,057
in order to see what the game play is like with different settings.

8
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,421
The game view also allows you to set resolution

9
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:42,958
specific to the target platform that you're using.

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,845
For example my game view is set to Standalone

11
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,922
with a resolution of 1280 by 720.

12
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:51,383
If I choose to then maximise on play

13
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:54,046
the game view will restrict to exactly that resolution

14
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:56,022
so that I can see what it will look like.

15
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:13,179
To adjust this I go to Edit - Project Settings - Player

16
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:14,695
and this shows me the default

17
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:17,329
screen width and height under resolution.

18
00:01:18,113 --> 00:01:19,781
If I edit this

19
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:23,219
I will see the change made immediately in the game view.

20
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:26,439
And if I choose to switch to a different target platform

21
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,700
I will get the resolution for that setting.

22
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:32,033
For example if I switch to Web Player

23
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,067
and return

24
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:36,802
Web Player is then featured 

25
00:01:36,802 --> 00:01:39,156
as the target platform I'm building for

26
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:41,156
and the preview mode for the game view.

27
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:49,320
In addition to Maximise On Play

28
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,503
the game view also has a Stats button

29
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:53,996
to allow you to see performance statistics

30
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:55,884
based on your game

31
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:59,237
and also the ability to show Gizmos in the same

32
00:01:59,237 --> 00:02:01,332
way that the Scene view shows them already.

33
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:07,284
As you can adjust things whilst in play mode

34
00:02:07,284 --> 00:02:08,646
you should also be aware

35
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:11,067
that any changes that you make will be undone

36
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:13,244
when returning to your project.

37
00:02:13,244 --> 00:02:14,918
This is specific to changes that are

38
00:02:14,918 --> 00:02:16,830
based on game objects in your scene

39
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,982
and not game objects that refgerence assets in the project.

40
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:24,545
For example if I was to change something relating to a material

41
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,066
that change is made to the original asset.

42
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:30,106
Whereas if I was to change something on a specific component

43
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:32,993
that change will be undone when play is pressed again.

44
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:35,317
It's also worth being aware 

45
00:02:35,317 --> 00:02:38,013
that when you press play, your game is running

46
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:39,961
and you can hint this by going to 

47
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,261
Unity - Preferences on Mac

48
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:44,584
or Edit - Preferences on PC.

49
00:02:45,617 --> 00:02:47,424
You can choose under Colours

50
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,099
a play mode tint,

51
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:51,099
I've chosen a shade of blue,

52
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:53,099
but I can make this any colour that I need to.

53
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:56,242
That way, when you press play 

54
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,620
the rest of the interface will change to this colour.

55
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,793
This is to remind you that you are in

56
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:02,708
play mode and will lose changes

57
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,437
if you continue to work in that mode.
