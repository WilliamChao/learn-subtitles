1
00:00:00,193 --> 00:00:03,026
The Build Settings can be accessed from the File menu

2
00:00:03,026 --> 00:00:05,320
by going to File - Build Settings.

3
00:00:05,481 --> 00:00:08,448
A build in development is a term used to describe

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:11,524
an exported executable form of your project.

5
00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:14,000
And given Unity's multiplatform nature

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,597
this varies for each platform.

7
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:19,073
For webplayers Unity will export an HTML file

8
00:00:19,073 --> 00:00:20,942
with example embedding code

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,538
and a .Unity 3D file which contains your game

10
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:27,115
and will be run by the Unity webplayer plug-in

11
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:28,280
in your browser.

12
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:32,746
For standalone Unity will export an executable version of your game

13
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:37,312
for PC, Mac and Linux.

14
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:41,450
For iOS Unity exports an Xcode project

15
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,402
that can be opened in Apple's Xcode SDK

16
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:46,402
and run on the device for testing

17
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:48,055
and submission to the app store.

18
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:51,588
For Android Unity exports an APK file

19
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:54,157
that can be opened in the Android SDK.

20
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:57,227
Flash exports an SWF file

21
00:00:57,227 --> 00:00:58,779
associated assets,

22
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:02,789
and yet again an HTML file with example embedding code.

23
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:06,742
Google Native Client exports a Google Chrome browser

24
00:01:06,742 --> 00:01:08,481
compatible webplayer game.

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,935
And for consoles Unity builds directly to your

26
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:13,611
hardware development kit.

27
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,928
The build settings work with Unity's player settings

28
00:01:17,928 --> 00:01:19,928
to define settings for the build that you create.

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,144
Split in to cross-platform and per-platform

30
00:01:23,144 --> 00:01:26,986
you can set some basic values at the top and then choose settings below

31
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,375
that are specific for the platform you are developing for.

32
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,648
One thing to note as a beginner

33
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:35,119
is that the resolution in the Resolution and Presentation area

34
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,191
is the setting you can select for the game view.

35
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:47,093
For details of other per-platform settings

36
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:49,093
