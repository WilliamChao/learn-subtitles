00:00:00,193 --> 00:00:02,974
Prefabs in Unity are preconfigured game objects

2
00:00:02,974 --> 00:00:04,545
that you create in the scene

3
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:06,270
and store in the project.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,287
They can then be instantiated or cloned,

5
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:11,402
meaning to create an instance of them

6
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:12,349
during the game.

7
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:14,772
They have all manner of uses and are a key part

8
00:00:14,772 --> 00:00:16,032
of development in Unity.

9
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:18,188
They are used for everything from rockets

10
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:20,188
to enemies, to procedural levels.

11
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:23,562
To make a prefab simply create your game object

12
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:26,013
in it's desired configuration in your scene,

13
00:00:26,013 --> 00:00:28,013
from whatever components you need,

14
00:00:28,013 --> 00:00:30,013
and then drag it to the project panel

15
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:31,637
to save it as a prefab.

16
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,460
It can then be deleted from the scene.

17
00:00:35,889 --> 00:00:39,585
To edit a prefab you can either select it in the project,

18
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:41,856
and adjust properties in the inspector.

19
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:45,425
Or drag an instance of it back in to the scene,

20
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:48,383
edit it in the inspector,

21
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:51,764
and then press the apply button at the top.

22
00:00:52,818 --> 00:00:55,032
This saves changes back in to the prefab

23
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:57,042
and you can then remove the instance from the scene

24
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:58,316
yet again.

25
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:04,043
Also, if you have many instances of a prefab,

26
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:08,598
and you make edits to one of them,

27
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:13,968
and decide you would like others to be the same

28
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:15,064
you can hit apply.

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,893
The other instances will inherit this update

30
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:18,361
from the prefab's settings.

31
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:20,893
Likewise if you make a change to

32
00:01:20,893 --> 00:01:22,893
one of your instances

33
00:01:24,547 --> 00:01:26,623
and you decide you don't like it anymore

34
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:29,093
you can revert to the settings of the prefab

35
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:31,396
by clicking the revert button at the top.
