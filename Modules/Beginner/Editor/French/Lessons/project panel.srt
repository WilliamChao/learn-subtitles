1
00:00:00,308 --> 00:00:02,052
The Project Panel is where you store 

2
00:00:02,052 --> 00:00:04,403
all of the assets that make up your game.

3
00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:06,403
Anything you create with the panel,

4
00:00:06,403 --> 00:00:09,062
and any asset you import, will be kept here.

5
00:00:09,062 --> 00:00:11,844
You can create Unity-specific assets by clicking the

6
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:13,172
create button at the top.

7
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,793
Or import assets created in an external application.

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,133
You can import by right clicking,

9
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:25,653
by using the top menu

10
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:31,620
or simply by adding files to the assets folder in your operating system

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,732
or by saving from another application.

12
00:00:34,646 --> 00:00:37,626
The project panel is a mirror of your assets folder.

13
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:45,847
And when viewing the assets folder in your operating system

14
00:00:45,847 --> 00:00:48,220
you'll notice that meta files are created for

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,349
every asset that's placed in to the project.

16
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:53,107
Note that once the asset is in you should always use

17
00:00:53,107 --> 00:00:55,337
the project panel to move it around or edit it

18
00:00:55,337 --> 00:00:57,513
rather than using your operating system

19
00:00:57,513 --> 00:01:00,251
as this can break lines in the library of your project.

20
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:03,050
The project panel has two styles of view,

21
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,050
one and two column.

22
00:01:05,546 --> 00:01:07,972
These can be switched by clicking the context menu

23
00:01:07,972 --> 00:01:10,267
button in the top right.

24
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:16,120
One column view lets you see assets in a simple hierarchy as shown here.

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,760
Two column view gives you more flexibility

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,121
and more options to work with assets.

27
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:25,739
You can select, move and duplicate assets in the project.

28
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:27,739
Create and organise in to folders.

29
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,709
As well as label assets and search for them.

30
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,726
Assets can also be previewed in a thumbnail form

31
00:01:38,726 --> 00:01:40,860
by dragging the slider at the bottom,

32
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,527
with hierarchies then being shown with a right-arrow

33
00:01:43,527 --> 00:01:46,087
that can be used to expand or collapse them.

34
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:49,103
Assets can also be searched for

35
00:01:49,103 --> 00:01:50,843
and sorted by their name,

36
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:57,215
their type, a label

37
00:02:00,552 --> 00:02:02,552
or by a favourite grouping.

38
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:08,118
To create favourites you could perform a search

39
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:10,338
and then click the star button in the top right

40
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,338
and give your new group a name.

41
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:20,847
You can even search the assets store from the project browser.

42
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:23,138
By typing in the standard search field

43
00:02:23,138 --> 00:02:25,626
and switching from assets to asset store.
