Tags are a way of identifying game objects in Unity.

2
00:00:03,455 --> 00:00:05,895
As a name of a single object could identify it,

3
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:08,240
it can be useful to set tags also.

4
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:12,073
For example you may have an object called Ork or Tank

5
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:14,073
but these could all be tagged Enemy,

6
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:16,522
and in your code you could check for any objects

7
00:00:16,522 --> 00:00:17,938
that have the tag Enemy.

8
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,521
Likewise a script on an enemy could check for a player character

9
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,005
by looking for a player tag.

10
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:26,433
To assign a tag to an object, select it and use the

11
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:28,771
drop-down menu at the top of the inspector.

12
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:34,912
If the tag you want isn't already present then add a new tag.

13
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:38,367
You can add a tag by clicking the option at the bottom of the menu

14
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:41,259
and then entering it in the list of tags at the top

15
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:42,997
of the tag manager.

16
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:45,053
Once you've done this, return to the object you

17
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:46,262
wish to place the tag on

18
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:48,903
and select it from the drop-down.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,997
There are a number of functions in code,

20
00:00:51,997 --> 00:00:54,508
which will allow you to find objects with tags,

21
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:57,887
the simplest one of these is GameObject.FindWithTag,

22
00:00:57,887 --> 00:01:00,582
which allows you to specify a string with the name

23
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:01,647
of the tag inside it.

24
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:04,957
This script is attached to my enemy object

25
00:01:06,886 --> 00:01:10,304
and I can use that to find an object with the tag Player.

26
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:13,044
So I'll set my robot to be tagged Player

27
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:20,110
and when the game starts my enemy is seeking out that

28
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,311
object and looking at it.

29
00:01:22,993 --> 00:01:26,089
Likewise you could find multiple objects with the same tag

30
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:29,036
by using FindGameObjectWithTag.

31
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:34,086
See the scripting reference for more examples of this.
