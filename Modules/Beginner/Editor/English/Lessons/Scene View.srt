1
00:00:00,393 --> 00:00:03,309
The Scene view is where you will visually construct your game.

2
00:00:03,506 --> 00:00:06,656
And this can be navigated by making use of the buttons above the view.

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,118
These buttons correspond to the Q, W, E and R buttons on the keyboard.

4
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:16,235
The first button, the Hand Tool, is purely for navigating.

5
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:20,398
With this tool selected drag with the left mouse button to pan, 

6
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:24,532
and with the right mouse button to look around First Person style.

7
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:29,052
Hold the Alt key with this tool and left mouse button drag 

8
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:31,749
will let you orbit around the point you were looking at.

9
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:37,180
Whilst Alt and right mouse button dragging will zoom the view.

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,157
With any object selected in the hierarchy

11
00:00:43,157 --> 00:00:46,760
you can focus on the object either by double clicking the object's name

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,922
or by pressing F with the mouse cursor over the Scene view.

13
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:58,082
The remaining three buttons allow you adjust position,

14
00:00:58,082 --> 00:01:00,842
rotation and scale of objects.

15
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:03,221
By dragging the corresponding axis handles

16
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:07,034
you can move objects in X, Y or Z.

17
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:11,433
Likewise this also applies to moving in 3D

18
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:13,419
by dragging from the centre,

19
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:15,732
although this is not necessarily recommended

20
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:18,063
for moving in 3D space.

21
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:22,892
Likewise for rotating you can rotate in all three axes,

22
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:25,658
or you can just drag from within those, 

23
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:28,291
but again a lack of control will occur

24
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,549
when trying to drag in all three axes at once.

25
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:34,406
And again with scaling 

26
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:37,550
you can scale objects in all three individual axes

27
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,068
or drag from the centre point in order to scale uniformly. 

28
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:44,103
In this instance it is recommended to drag from the centre

29
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,833
in order to keep scale properties in proportion.

30
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:52,464
In the main bar of the Scene view you will see two drop-down menus

31
00:01:52,464 --> 00:01:55,004
that handle how the Scene view is rendered.

32
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:58,629
You can switch to wireframe

33
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:02,867
or look at alpha of how your objects are displayed for example.

34
00:02:03,942 --> 00:02:06,159
These are followed by three toggles. 

35
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,052
The first toggle toggles lighting in the scene

36
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:12,765
The second - whether a skybox is rendered or not.

37
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:16,192
And the third allows you to preview audio from the game

38
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,087
from wherever the editor camera is currently located.

39
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:26,473
The editor camera simply refers to the camera

40
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:28,198
that you are looking at the Scene view from.

41
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:30,685
It is not a camera object in your scene.

42
00:02:31,675 --> 00:02:34,775
So for example if I were to move my camera very far

43
00:02:34,775 --> 00:02:38,509
away from the sound source and preview the audio again.

44
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:43,750
You can hear that it's quieter than it was before.

45
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,943
To the right of the panel are the Gizmo menu and search box.

46
00:02:48,249 --> 00:02:50,407
The Gizmo menu lets you adjust gizmos, 

47
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:52,801
the 2D icon shown in the Scene view

48
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,288
to help you identify components in the scene.

49
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:58,439
Such as lights, audio sources or cameras.

50
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:00,881
These can be adjusted by size

51
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,961
and also be toggled between 2D and 3D.

52
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:09,508
The search field lets you to search for a particular object by searching for its name.

53
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:14,639
And this highlights the object by fading out other objects in your scene.

54
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,776
Again, if you are not focused on the actual object that you've found by searching 

55
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:24,696
then you can simply use the Focus feature to find it.

56
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:29,673
This search also singles out the object in the Hierarchy 

57
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:32,548
so by then selecting the object you were looking for

58
00:03:32,548 --> 00:03:35,861
and pressing F to focus, or double clicking -

59
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:37,861
you will then be taken to that object.

60
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:40,210
The final part of the Scene view you should

61
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,216
understand is the View Gizmo itself.

62
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:45,499
This allows you to switch from Perspective 3D view

63
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:48,896
to Orthographic cameras from sides, top and bottom.

64
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:55,986
When dragging to orbit your view in Orthographic view

65
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,564
you will be switching to Isometric view.

66
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:03,240
You will be notified of this by the term

67
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,682
ISO written underneath the View Gizmo

68
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:09,475
but do not confuse this with actual 3D Perspective view  

69
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:12,328
and be aware that you can switch back to Perspective view

70
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:14,372
simply by clicking on the white cube

71
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:16,372
in the centre of the View Gizmo.
