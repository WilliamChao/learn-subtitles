1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,790
The Audio Listener component is the equivalent 

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,335
of your ears in the game.

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,616
It receives, or listens, to audio sources

4
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:08,844
that are in the game world.

5
00:00:09,238 --> 00:00:11,657
The control of the audio's behaviour is done on

6
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:13,201
the audio source component

7
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:16,116
and therefore the listener itself has no settings.

8
00:00:17,436 --> 00:00:20,469
This is attached to a camera in your scene by default

9
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:22,469
but can be placed on any object.

10
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:24,691
Often this is attached to a character

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,946
and crucially there can be only one listener

12
00:00:26,946 --> 00:00:29,814
per scene in order for it to function correctly.

13
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,131
You can test an audio listener from any position in the world 

14
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:35,131
by moving the scene camera around

15
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:38,324
with the audio preview toggle enabled.

16
00:00:54,115 --> 00:00:56,492
This gives you live testing of audio sources

17
00:00:56,492 --> 00:00:58,614
in your environment without having to move 

18
00:00:58,614 --> 00:01:00,991
the real listener or play test the game.

19
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:05,951
Audio sources are components that playback audio.

20
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:08,459
Think of them as speakers in the game world.

21
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,021
In this example our turbine has an audio source attached

22
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:14,795
with the turbine audio clip that's been applied to it.

23
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:17,101
We can assign a clip by dragging and dropping,

24
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:19,886
or by using code to select a clip to play.

25
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,560
We can mute, bypass any filters,

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,167
choose whether to play this audio source on awake,

27
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:27,009
as in - when the game begins

28
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:28,567
and whether to loop the clip.

29
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:32,180
Priority varies between 0 and 255,

30
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,407
0 being the highest priority.

31
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,035
It's advisable to have music set as the highest priority

32
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:39,856
to avoid other clips from overriding

33
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:41,602
when many clips are being played at once.

34
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:43,912
Volume determines how loud the clip is played

35
00:01:43,912 --> 00:01:45,490
based on it's original waveform.

36
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,740
Pitch controls the pitch of a clip.

37
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:49,857
If you're working with 3D sounds

38
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:51,412
the settings are more detailed.

39
00:01:51,595 --> 00:01:53,970
Doppler level defines how much the Doppler Effect

40
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,824
will be used.

41
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:57,693
This is a perceived shift in frequency as the listener

42
00:01:57,693 --> 00:01:59,693
or the ear in real terms 

43
00:01:59,693 --> 00:02:01,693
is moving past the sound source.

44
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:04,075
It will seem higher approaching it

45
00:02:04,075 --> 00:02:06,075
and lower as it moves away.

46
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:09,178
Think of an emergency vehicle's siren as it passes you

47
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:09,997
for example.

48
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,473
Volume roll-off determines the type of roll-off 

49
00:02:12,473 --> 00:02:14,111
to be used by the sound

50
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:15,970
as the listener moves away from it.

51
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,788
This can be logarithmic, linear, 

52
00:02:18,788 --> 00:02:22,508
or customised manually using a curve

53
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,508
and adding keys as shown.

54
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:31,789
The minimum distance defines how close 

55
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:33,362
to play the sound at full volume.

56
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,362
So if you are designing 3D sound

57
00:02:35,362 --> 00:02:38,009
use this value to make the sound source louder.

58
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:41,483
This can be adjusted using the spherical Gizmo

59
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:42,776
in the scene view.

60
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:50,903
And it works in the conjunction with the 

61
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:52,903
maximum distance setting below,

62
00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:55,649
which by default is set to 500 metres

63
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:57,901
and is a distance after which

64
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,668
the sound rolls off.

65
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:07,734
Pan level defines how truly 3D the sound is.

66
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:10,123
This defaults to 1 for 3D sound

67
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,302
making it fully panned when the stereo listener

68
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:13,039
is moved past it.

69
00:03:13,303 --> 00:03:15,570
Spread is the control of the angle of spread

70
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,430
from 3D stereo to multichannel sound.

71
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:22,146
Finally for 2D sound pan can be controlled

72
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:23,465
at the bottom of the component.

73
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:25,430
As a rule elements such as music

74
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,014
should be set to 2D sound,

75
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:28,944
whilst diegetic sound that should be

76
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:30,982
fading realistically should be set up

77
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:33,418
as 3D and positioned accordingly.

78
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:35,863
The 2D and 3D values of a sound

79
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:38,867
are controlled by an audio clip's import settings.

80
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:41,915
When selecting a clip in the project

81
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:43,592
you will be able to see the import settings

82
00:03:43,592 --> 00:03:44,511
in the inspector.

83
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:47,149
You can choose the audio format to use,

84
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:50,105
whether it should be 3D or 2D sound,

85
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,268
whether you want to force your stereo sound to mono,

86
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:56,972
how to load it and what compression to use.

87
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:59,636
You can also preview sound at the bottom,

88
00:04:01,193 --> 00:04:03,193
choose whether to loop whilst previewing

89
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:06,756
and set the inspector to auto-play

90
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:08,756
whilst browsing through clips.
