1
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:02,299
Textures.

2
00:00:02,385 --> 00:00:04,385
A texture is an image file.

3
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:07,371
Unity uses textures in a number of different ways.

4
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:09,801
The most common use of a texture is when

5
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,845
applied to a material in the base

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,691
texture property to give a mesh a

7
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:15,118
textured surface.

8
00:00:15,618 --> 00:00:17,438
For more information on materials

9
00:00:17,438 --> 00:00:19,438
see the appropriate lesson.

10
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:21,796
Textures can also be used for 

11
00:00:21,796 --> 00:00:23,643
GUI elements applied to additional 

12
00:00:23,643 --> 00:00:25,601
material properties to act as normal

13
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:27,601
maps, specular maps or height maps.

14
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:30,214
Used as custom cursors, icons,

15
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:32,214
splash screens and more.

16
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,780
Textures can be any image file 

17
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,873
supported by Unity. 

18
00:00:35,873 --> 00:00:37,635
These can be photos straight from a

19
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:39,635
digital source, but textures are usually

20
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:42,333
images created or manipulated in an image

21
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,861
editor, like Photoshop or Gimp.

22
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,514
It is important to note that the layered

23
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,293
files will be flattened on import

24
00:00:49,293 --> 00:00:51,027
but the layers are maintained in

25
00:00:51,027 --> 00:00:53,027
Unity in the original file.

26
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:55,279
This means we can turn layers on and off

27
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:57,279
without loss when we're setting up our game

28
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:59,328
but when we're running our game we will not

29
00:00:59,328 --> 00:01:01,328
have access to these layers individually.

30
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:03,994
Most of the image file formats used by

31
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:05,870
Unity support transparency.

32
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:07,927
The notable exception is JPEG,

33
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:09,066
which does not.

34
00:01:09,428 --> 00:01:11,026
For more information on transparency

35
00:01:11,026 --> 00:01:12,831
and how to use it, see the documentation on

36
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:14,568
materials and shaders.

37
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:18,069
Texture files should be saved in the assets folder.

38
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:20,223
Unity searches the assets folder

39
00:01:20,223 --> 00:01:22,514
in a specific order when seeking materials.

40
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:25,399
For more information on searching for textures

41
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:27,273
and seeking materials see the lesson

42
00:01:27,273 --> 00:01:28,952
on mesh importing.

43
00:01:30,377 --> 00:01:32,377
A texture file should be assigned import

44
00:01:32,377 --> 00:01:34,377
settings in the texture importer.

45
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:36,514
Texture Type property contains a 

46
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,735
list of presets. 

47
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,363
These limit the number of editable properties

48
00:01:40,363 --> 00:01:42,170
available in the texture importer

49
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,407
based on the intended use for the image.

50
00:01:45,043 --> 00:01:47,043
The default is Texture.

51
00:01:47,957 --> 00:01:50,263
Advanced will expose all of the available

52
00:01:50,263 --> 00:01:52,263
properties in the texture importer.

53
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:55,025
The other presets, including advanced,

54
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:57,025
will be covered in another lesson.

55
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,229
If we need to set the transparency

56
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:03,192
or alpha channel for the texture automatically

57
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:05,192
based on the light and dark parts of the image

58
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,044
we can check the Alpha From Greyscale field.

59
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,544
Black will be completely transparent,

60
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:12,544
white will be completely opaque.

61
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:15,154
Wrap Mode controls how the texture is mapped

62
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:17,015
on to a renderer when tiled.

63
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:19,515
This setting works for both 2D elements

64
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,112
and 3D meshes.

65
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:24,496
Repeat will repeat the texture and 

66
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:27,117
and Clamp will stretch the edges of the texture.

67
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:29,700
Filter Mode controls how the graphics

68
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,061
card renders the texture, 

69
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:33,809
when it is stretched by 3D transformations.

70
00:02:34,406 --> 00:02:36,585
These are effectively quality settings,

71
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:38,488
trilinear being the best and 

72
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:40,488
point being the most basic.

73
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:43,278
Aniso level controls the quality of 

74
00:02:43,278 --> 00:02:45,993
textures when rendered at steep angles.

75
00:02:46,548 --> 00:02:48,548
Anisotropic Filtering increases the

76
00:02:48,548 --> 00:02:50,228
texture quality when viewed at

77
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:51,456
a grazing angle.

78
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:53,986
This has an increased rendering cost when applied.

79
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:56,403
In quality settings, Anisotropic filtering

80
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:58,403
can be forced on for all textures

81
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:00,053
or disabled completely.

82
00:03:00,249 --> 00:03:02,166
For more information on quality settings

83
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,166
see the appropriate lesson.

84
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,459
Because Unity supports building to

85
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,932
multiple target platforms from one project

86
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:11,168
the texture importer allows for a default

87
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:13,075
setting for max texture size

88
00:03:13,075 --> 00:03:14,893
and compression format that can be

89
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:17,419
overridden on a per platform basis.

90
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,739
Max Size will set the maximum size for

91
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,093
for the imported texture.

92
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:23,690
If max size is set to a value larger

93
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,690
than that of the original image the size

94
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,815
of the imported texture

95
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:28,355
will be that of the original.

96
00:03:28,703 --> 00:03:30,455
This setting will not make the texture

97
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:32,455
larger than the original image.

98
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,037
If max size is set to a value less

99
00:03:35,037 --> 00:03:37,357
than the original image the texture will

100
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:39,758
be resized to that value on import.

101
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:41,775
Like layers, however, the original

102
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:43,287
file is unchanged.

103
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:45,995
Only the imported asset will be adjusted.

104
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:49,089
Format sets the compression technique.

105
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,520
The default settings are relatively simple

106
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
when using the Texture preset.

107
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:56,103
These are effectively quality settings of

108
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,880
low, medium and high.

109
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:00,092
More control can be set on a per

110
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:03,085
platform basis, or when using the Advanced setting.

111
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:06,317
Each target platform can have it's own settings

112
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:08,840
that override the default values.

113
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:11,506
Max size and compression can be adjusted

114
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:13,159
for each target platform.

115
00:04:13,424 --> 00:04:15,424
This means we can set the target sizes

116
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:17,763
and compression appropriate for the

117
00:04:17,763 --> 00:04:19,374
bandwidth and processing power

118
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:20,997
of the target platform.

119
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,605
When the build target is changed these

120
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:25,605
assets will be reimported using the

121
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:27,357
overridden values.

122
00:04:28,037 --> 00:04:30,764
This section works in conjunction with Build Settings.

123
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:32,387
For more information on Build Settings

124
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:34,387
please see the appropriate lesson.

125
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:37,417
At the bottom of the importer is a preview window.

126
00:04:37,655 --> 00:04:39,361
When the preview window is open we can

127
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:40,918
view the changes we have made.

128
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:43,321
We will need to apply our settings before

129
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:45,711
the preview window will update it's display.

130
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:48,030
The preview window will display the image

131
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,030
being imported and report basic information

132
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,030
about the imported texture, including

133
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,698
the size of the imported texture,

134
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:55,436
the compression setting and the footprint

135
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:57,436
of the texture in our game.
