1
00:00:01,575 --> 00:00:03,070
The Mesh Renderer.

2
00:00:03,446 --> 00:00:05,916
To render a mesh we need 2 components.

3
00:00:06,126 --> 00:00:07,549
The Mesh Filter

4
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,049
and the Mesh Renderer.

5
00:00:11,806 --> 00:00:13,363
When importing a mesh model

6
00:00:13,363 --> 00:00:15,100
Unity will automatically create a

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,100
prefab asset that includes a mesh filter

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,077
component to hold the mesh data for the model

9
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:22,077
and a mesh renderer component

10
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:24,712
to render this mesh data in our scene.

11
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:26,728
The mesh renderer does not

12
00:00:26,728 --> 00:00:28,015
render skinned meshes.

13
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:30,692
Skinned meshes are used for rendering characters.

14
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:32,692
Characters are animated using bones

15
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,692
and every bone effects part of the mesh.

16
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:36,748
If the model is skinned, 

17
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:38,915
Unity will create a skinned mesh renderer

18
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:40,694
for the imported model instead.

19
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:43,153
Information on skinned mesh renderers

20
00:00:43,153 --> 00:00:45,153
can be found in another lesson.

21
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:48,026
Each mesh asset needs it's own mesh filter

22
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:49,384
and mesh renderer.

23
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,422
If the model is made of several

24
00:00:51,422 --> 00:00:53,727
separate meshes each will have it's own

25
00:00:53,727 --> 00:00:55,727
prefab game object with it's own

26
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:57,727
mesh filter - mesh renderer pair.

27
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:01,900
The mesh filter holds the mesh data of the model

28
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,900
and passes it to the mesh renderer

29
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,417
for rendering on screen.

30
00:01:05,972 --> 00:01:07,415
The mesh filter component

31
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:09,540
has only one property and this is

32
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,132
a reference to the mesh asset itself.

33
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:16,123
The mesh renderer takes the mesh model 

34
00:01:16,123 --> 00:01:18,123
data from the mesh filter and renders

35
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:20,123
it in our scene at the position,

36
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:22,123
rotation and scale defined by

37
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,123
the object's transform component. 

38
00:01:25,272 --> 00:01:27,272
The mesh renderer has properties that

39
00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:29,037
define how the model will be rendered

40
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:31,037
or drawn in our scene.

41
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:33,261
These fall in to 3 broad categories.

42
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:37,323
Shadows, materials and light probes.

43
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:40,238
With shadows, if there is a shadow

44
00:01:40,238 --> 00:01:42,238
casting light on the object we can

45
00:01:42,238 --> 00:01:44,210
set whether the mesh renderer will

46
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,210
cast and or receive shadows.

47
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,656
Next there is a list of materials

48
00:01:48,656 --> 00:01:50,335
to render the object with.

49
00:01:50,614 --> 00:01:52,820
Unity needs at least one material assigned

50
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
to the mesh renderer to be able to draw

51
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,294
that object in our scene.

52
00:01:56,518 --> 00:01:58,878
For more information on materials themselves

53
00:01:58,878 --> 00:02:00,878
see the appropriate lesson.

54
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:04,082
Meshes imported in to Unity can

55
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,082
use multiple materials, if the mesh

56
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:07,761
model has been setup to do so

57
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,761
in the original modelling application.

58
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,497
The mesh renderer maintains a list

59
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:14,993
simply called Materials for all materials

60
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:16,687
used by the mesh model.

61
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:20,658
Often this list only contains one material.

62
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:25,324
This materials list should have one slot

63
00:02:25,324 --> 00:02:27,212
in the list for each sub mesh

64
00:02:27,212 --> 00:02:28,395
on the mesh model.

65
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:31,536
If any given slot has no material assigned

66
00:02:31,536 --> 00:02:33,924
the associated mesh will show pink

67
00:02:33,924 --> 00:02:35,924
indicating that the material is missing.

68
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,602
Lastly, there are light probes.

69
00:02:40,088 --> 00:02:42,088
A mesh can be lit by light probes.

70
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:45,004
Light probes sample the lighting of a scene

71
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:47,004
at a point and cast that light on

72
00:02:47,004 --> 00:02:48,260
on to the rendered mesh.

73
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:50,207
This is often used in conjunction

74
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:51,254
with light mapping.

75
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:53,644
Light probes light dynamic objects

76
00:02:53,644 --> 00:02:55,924
such as characters that would not receive

77
00:02:55,924 --> 00:02:57,924
baked lighting information from a light map.

78
00:02:58,907 --> 00:03:00,514
To use light probes,

79
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,306
the Use Light Probes option must be enabled.

80
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:05,445
For more information on light probes,

81
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:07,445
including the Anchor Override property,

82
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:09,196
please see the appropriate lesson

83
00:03:09,196 --> 00:03:11,196
and documentation link below.
