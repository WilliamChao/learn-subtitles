1
00:00:00,953 --> 00:00:02,308
3D Meshes.

2
00:00:02,656 --> 00:00:04,656
Scenes in Unity are created by

3
00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:06,863
using 3D or polygonal meshes.

4
00:00:07,363 --> 00:00:09,363
Polygonal meshes are the underpinnings

5
00:00:09,363 --> 00:00:11,363
of all games made in Unity.

6
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:13,712
Whether it's a simple 2D game where the

7
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:16,014
characters are attached to a simple plane,

8
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:18,638
a complex particle system full of sprites,

9
00:00:18,638 --> 00:00:21,385
or a full 3D game with animated characters -

10
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:23,719
that game will use meshes.

11
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:26,108
All objects in our game, from a simple

12
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:28,385
quad or basic plane, to a complex

13
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:31,253
3D character or environmental geometry

14
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:33,253
will be a polygonal mesh.

15
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,731
Polygonal meshes, or simply meshes

16
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:39,253
are created from very simple basic elements.

17
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:41,253
Points and lines.

18
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:44,651
The points are called Vertices

19
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:45,970
or Verts for short.

20
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,190
A single point is a Vertex.

21
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:51,070
These define a point in 3D space.

22
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,460
Between these points lines are drawn.

23
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,671
These lines are called Edges.

24
00:00:56,074 --> 00:00:58,776
The edges create something called a Polygon.

25
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:00,776
which in Unity will be a triangle.

26
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:04,676
These polygons define the mesh of our object.

27
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:08,253
The meshes used in Unity

28
00:01:08,253 --> 00:01:10,463
are not created in Unity.

29
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:12,463
With the exception of the basic primitive

30
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:14,463
shapes which are built in to Unity

31
00:01:14,463 --> 00:01:16,463
all of the meshes that we will be using

32
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:18,282
need to be created in an external

33
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:19,992
mesh modelling application.

34
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:22,564
These mesh models, either created or

35
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:24,564
purchased will need to be imported in to

36
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:26,564
Unity for use in our scenes.

37
00:01:26,898 --> 00:01:29,576
