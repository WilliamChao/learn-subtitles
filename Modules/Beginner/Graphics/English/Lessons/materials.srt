1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,645
Materials in Unity are the assets that control

2
00:00:02,645 --> 00:00:04,645
the visual appearance of game objects.

3
00:00:05,145 --> 00:00:07,461
Applied to a renderer component,

4
00:00:07,461 --> 00:00:09,225
the material is essentially an asset

5
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:11,489
that brings together a shader, a script

6
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:14,169
that controls the appearance of a rendered surface

7
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:16,365
and it's required properties, such as

8
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:18,001
colours and textures.

9
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,119
Materials can be made by using the

10
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:22,119
Create button on the project panel.

11
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:24,203
And once you've created this asset

12
00:00:24,203 --> 00:00:26,754
it can be assigned to a renderer component

13
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:29,851
and a shader can be chosen from the drop down list.

14
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:31,835
Materials can also be generated from

15
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:33,835
models brought in from 3D packages

16
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:35,506
but we will discuss this later.

17
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:37,536
As a basic example

18
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:40,146
if we have a primitive cube in Unity

19
00:00:46,585 --> 00:00:49,323
and an example material ready to use on it

20
00:00:49,323 --> 00:00:51,323
we can assign this to the mesh renderer.

21
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:54,013
The mesh renderer is the component used

22
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:56,013
to render any 3D mesh.

23
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,289
We'll assign this to the materials slot.

24
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:02,791
By default a primitive mesh has

25
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,152
Unity's default-diffuse material assigned to it.

26
00:01:05,428 --> 00:01:07,987
We will replace this with our example material.

27
00:01:08,212 --> 00:01:09,882
Whilst I have assigned this material

28
00:01:09,882 --> 00:01:12,640
by dragging it directly to the material's property

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,557
I could also assign it by dragging it to the model

30
00:01:15,798 --> 00:01:17,383
or dropping it in to the scene.

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,437
And you can see that Unity previews what that 

32
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:21,288
material would look like on the mesh

33
00:01:21,288 --> 00:01:22,735
that we're dropping on to.

34
00:01:23,512 --> 00:01:25,842
Once assigned we see settings for this material

35
00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:27,842
below other components in the inspector.

36
00:01:27,842 --> 00:01:30,203
It's important to know that this part of the inspector's

37
00:01:30,203 --> 00:01:32,495
settings are simply a shortcut to editing

38
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:33,761
the material asset.

39
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,708
This is important because when changing the

40
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,708
properties of a material on the object

41
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,817
you are actually changing the material asset itself.

42
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:43,901
For example if I make this material red.

43
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:49,025
The asset has been made red.

44
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:50,668
So for example

45
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,294
if I have a sphere

46
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:01,767
and assign the same material

47
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:04,353
it too will be red.

48
00:02:04,663 --> 00:02:06,854
And when adjusting that material on

49
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:08,854
either of those two objects

50
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:12,319
we're simply adjusting the asset so any object

51
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,891
using that material will be changed too.

52
00:02:17,342 --> 00:02:19,221
When introducing 3D assets from

53
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:21,497
a modelling application Unity will create

54
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:23,980
the materials in a materials subfolder

55
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,756
in the location of the asset

56
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:28,256
as well as assigning textures for you.

57
00:02:28,756 --> 00:02:30,843
For example this blast door asset has been

58
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:32,843
brought in to Unity and we have saved

59
00:02:32,843 --> 00:02:35,659
it's textures in to folder called Textures

60
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,902
which Unity automatically searches

61
00:02:37,902 --> 00:02:39,729
in order to reassign it to the material 

62
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:40,728
that it creates.

63
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:43,004
The two parts of the asset are the door

64
00:02:43,124 --> 00:02:44,239
and the frame.

65
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:46,600
Both of these assets share the same material

66
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,704
and simply use different parts of the texture

67
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,545
to render them.

68
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:51,648
The material that's being created is

69
00:02:51,648 --> 00:02:53,648
Prop_Blastdoor

70
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:55,681
and I can see that if I click on it

71
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:57,681
it's highlighted in the project panel.

72
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:02,781
As standard when introducing this

73
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:05,360
we would be shown a diffuse shader.

74
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:07,809
This is a flat standard look for 

75
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:09,312
rendering 3D meshes.

76
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,899
We have a normal map for this asset

77
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:13,899
so we can instead choose a bumped shader

78
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:15,585
such as Bump Diffuse

79
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:17,241
to make use of this texture.

80
00:03:17,241 --> 00:03:19,137
The normal map is a way of storing

81
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:21,137
height and directional information

82
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,927
that is projected onto the surface

83
00:03:22,927 --> 00:03:24,141
of a flat mesh

84
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:25,951
in order to give it the appearance of

85
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:27,846
surface detail without adding

86
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:29,846
vertices to the geometry itself.

87
00:03:30,553 --> 00:03:32,379
And if you look at the mesh in the scene or

88
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,944
game view you can see the difference

89
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:35,944
that this makes.

90
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:38,927
So the dents, grooves and scratches

91
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,927
on our blast door are accentuated

92
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:42,669
in the normal map texture.

93
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,858
We could also extend this to give

94
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,578
it a shiny surface by choosing

95
00:03:46,578 --> 00:03:48,072
Bumped Specular.

96
00:03:48,313 --> 00:03:50,716
Here, in addition to the texture and the normal map

97
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:53,285
we are also able to set the shininess.

98
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:58,638
So we've gone from our default flat look

99
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,638
to our nice shiny looking dented door

100
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:02,534
simply by adjusting the shader.

101
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,306
We haven't had to add any more detail to the

102
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:06,306
original model, and that's the true power

103
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:07,486
of using materials.

104
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,520
Unity ships with many shaders that will

105
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,520
cover all manner of game development needs

106
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,675
and you can also write your own shaders

107
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:14,845
and assign them.

108
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:17,621
You can create these also from using the

109
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:19,621
create button on the project panel.
