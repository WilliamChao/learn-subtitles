1
00:00:00,221 --> 00:00:01,671
For this assignment you will need the 

2
00:00:01,671 --> 00:00:03,671
robot lab, so download it using the link

3
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:05,505
on this page if you haven't already.

4
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,129
A Unity classic, this is the first thing 

5
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:09,129
you should try out in scripting.

6
00:00:09,129 --> 00:00:11,129
The classic Spinning Cube.

7
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:13,584
A very simple thing to achieve but an

8
00:00:13,584 --> 00:00:15,221
important first thing to try. 

9
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:17,221
Whilst you don't need the robot lab for this,

10
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:19,221
you can use an ordinary primitive cube,

11
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:21,221
it is worth downloading the package

12
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,221
for use with other assignments.

13
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:26,963
For this assignment open up the empty scene

14
00:00:26,963 --> 00:00:29,392
in the scenes folder in the project panel.

15
00:00:29,892 --> 00:00:31,892
Then go to File - Save Scene As

16
00:00:31,892 --> 00:00:36,628
to back it up. We will save this as Spinning Cube.

17
00:00:38,744 --> 00:00:40,744
And save it in to the Scenes folder.

18
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:43,948
Because we have done Save As we are now

19
00:00:43,948 --> 00:00:45,368
inside that scene.

20
00:00:46,849 --> 00:00:48,849
Go to the Models folder and grab

21
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,277
the prop powercube

22
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:53,277
and drag it in to the scene.

23
00:00:53,777 --> 00:00:55,777
Using the Translate tool

24
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:59,975
drag it up in the Y axis, and then press F

25
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:01,863
on the keyboard with your cursor over the

26
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:04,839
scene view in order to focus on that object.

27
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:07,103
We will quickly setup the lighting for this.

28
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:09,103
Make sure that this object is on the

29
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:10,745
dynamic objects layer.

30
00:01:11,423 --> 00:01:13,423
And then in the mesh renderer for the object

31
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:15,423
check Use Light Probes.

32
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,746
Now let's make our script.

33
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,065
Click the Add Component button at the 

34
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:25,429
bottom of the inspector. Go to New Script

35
00:01:26,702 --> 00:01:28,702
and call your new script Spin,

36
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:31,202
and click Create and Add.

37
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:36,188
Once it's added double click the icon

38
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:38,619
for the script to launch it for editing.

39
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:41,572
In order to make our cube spin

40
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:44,789
we will need to modify its transform every frame.

41
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:47,582
So we will make use of the update function.

42
00:01:47,582 --> 00:01:49,582
Delete the start function and the comments

43
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:50,975
that are in the script.

44
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:53,144
We want to be able to control the speed

45
00:01:53,144 --> 00:01:55,144
of this using the inspector

46
00:01:55,144 --> 00:01:57,144
so we will make a public variable that we

47
00:01:57,144 --> 00:01:58,490
can adjust there.

48
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,787
Start by adding a public float variable,

49
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:04,790
a decimal placed number, called 'speed'.

50
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,401
Then as stated we will effect the transform

51
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:10,002
of the object. So to begin we will start by

52
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:13,907
saying transform.rotate.

53
00:02:14,877 --> 00:02:16,724
And into the brackets we will specify a 

54
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:20,046
rotation, we are going to use vector3.up,

55
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:22,046
which is the shortcut to world-space up

56
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:26,041
direction, the vector3 (0, 1, 0).

57
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,768
And then we will use our speed variable

58
00:02:28,768 --> 00:02:32,607
and multiply this by time.deltaTime

59
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:34,441
in order to smooth it out.

60
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:36,066
If you are not familiar with DeltaTime

61
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:38,066
check out the lesson on this link below.

62
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:40,569
We will also give our speed variable

63
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:43,070
a default value. When we're done we will save

64
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,154
our script and return to Unity.

65
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:48,654
Now all we need to do is press play

66
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:51,621
and we have a spinning cube. And because

67
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:54,179
the speed variable is a public variable

68
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:55,495
we can adjust it

69
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:58,907
whilst the game is playing.

70
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:12,927
One other thing you may wish to do to 

71
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,382
finish this scene off is to select your

72
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:17,689
camera, so underneath cameras choose

73
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:18,964
camera01.

74
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:22,450
And with your scene view showing exactly

75
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,754
what you would like to see in the game

76
00:03:25,143 --> 00:03:26,689
select the camera and go to

77
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:29,975
Game Object - Align With View.

78
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:33,069
That will move the camera to the view that

79
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:35,069
you have setup in the scene view.

80
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:37,457
Now you can just press play again

81
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,917
and watch the results of your work.
