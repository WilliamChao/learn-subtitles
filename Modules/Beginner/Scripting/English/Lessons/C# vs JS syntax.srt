1
00:00:00,594 --> 00:00:04,396
In Unity scripts are made up of 1 or more classes.

2
00:00:04,396 --> 00:00:07,280
C# scripts have the class declarations

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,586
shown. In Javascript however, the declaration

4
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:12,739
is hidden, meaning that what you write

5
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:14,739
into the script is automatically

6
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:17,259
inside the class. It is the equivalent of

7
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:20,124
writing here in the C# script.

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,531
A variable declaration in C#

9
00:00:22,782 --> 00:00:25,086
starts with the type of variable you are

10
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:28,160
declaring. You then name the variable.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,294
You then have the option to give it a default value.

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,867
In Javascript a variable declaration

13
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:39,624
starts by using the keyword var.

14
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:41,624
We then name the variable.

15
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:44,124
After that we have the option to say what

16
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:46,124
type of variable it is we are declaring,

17
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:47,381
by using a colon. 

18
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,381
It is good practice to decide on a variable

19
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:51,147
type when declaring it.

20
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:54,297
We can then optionally give it a default value.

21
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,121
The line #pragma strict at the top

22
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:59,121
forces us to select a type.

23
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:02,288
A function declaration in C#

24
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:04,288
starts with a type of variable that will

25
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:05,899
return from the function.

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,360
Or the word void if we're not returning

27
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,767
anything from the function.

28
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:11,767
We then name the function.

29
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,767
We then have the parameter list,

30
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:15,767
also known as the arguments.

31
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,111
The contents of the function go here.

32
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,428
In Javascript a function declaration

33
00:01:23,428 --> 00:01:25,899
starts with the keyword function.

34
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:27,899
We then need to name the function.

35
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:29,661
Then comes the parameter list.

36
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Similarly to setting a variable type

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,040
we can use a colon

38
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,040
to set a return type for our function.

39
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:39,175
Another key difference between C# and

40
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:42,631
Javascript is the default access modifiers.

41
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:46,059
In C# the default is private.

42
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:50,255
Whereas in Javascript the default is public.

43
00:01:50,755 --> 00:01:52,603
See the lesson on variable scope and access

44
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:54,410
modifiers for more information.
