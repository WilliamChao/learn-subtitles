00:00:00,304 --> 00:00:02,638
Instantiate is a function to create

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,035
clones of game objects. This is commonly

3
00:00:05,035 --> 00:00:07,876
used in the context of cloning a prefab.

4
00:00:07,876 --> 00:00:09,876
A prefab is simply a preconfigured

5
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,515
object saved in the project's assets.

6
00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:14,515
One such example might be firing rockets

7
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,515
from a bazooka. Each of the rockets

8
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:18,515
would need to be instantiated in to the 

9
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:20,515
game world so that it could be fired.

10
00:00:20,515 --> 00:00:22,847
In this example we're using 'Fire1' to trigger

11
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:25,230
an instantiate function. The most basic 

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,179
form of instantiate simply takes one parameter,

13
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:30,179
the object that we wish to clone.

14
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,333
In this example we have created a public

15
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,346
variable called rocketPrefab and we're

16
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:37,346
passing this in to the instantiate command.

17
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:39,346
However this means that the prefab will be

18
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:41,346
instantiated at it's default position,

19
00:00:41,346 --> 00:00:45,428
which is 0. And in our example that position

20
00:00:45,428 --> 00:00:47,428
is the centre of the world, and the centre

21
00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:49,428
of where the bazooka is at the moment.

22
00:00:49,928 --> 00:00:51,399
So when we press play

23
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:54,400
those rockets appear at the centre

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,400
of the bazooka.

25
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:00,599
Instead we want to fire it like a rocket,

26
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:02,599
so it needs to appear to be coming from 

27
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:04,057
the barrel of our bazooka.

28
00:01:04,557 --> 00:01:06,557
For this we need a slightly different version

29
00:01:06,557 --> 00:01:09,084
of instantiate. This version of instantiate

30
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:11,084
takes three parameters,

31
00:01:11,084 --> 00:01:13,584
the object to be instantiated, in our case

32
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:15,929
the rocket prefab, and then a position

33
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:19,265
and rotation to give our new clone of the prefab.

34
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:24,721
For this I've created an empty gameobject

35
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:26,956
that's been positioned in front of the

36
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:29,213
bazookas barrel. We are using this by

37
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:31,686
creating a public variable called BarrelEnd

38
00:01:31,686 --> 00:01:34,019
and we use this component's position and rotation

39
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:36,413
values as those for the new clone of our 

40
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:39,214
rocket prefab. So by dragging and dropping this

41
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:42,988
new empty location to my script in the 

42
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:44,988
inspector I can 

43
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:48,038
receive the transform position and rotation

44
00:01:48,038 --> 00:01:50,909
by making use of the barrel end variable.

45
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,674
So when I press play and press fire

46
00:01:56,163 --> 00:01:58,163
the rocket appears in the right place

47
00:01:58,163 --> 00:02:00,163
but it just kind of drops,

48
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:01,788
which is not what we want.

49
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,788
We need to be able to effect the object

50
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:05,788
that's created by our instantiation,

51
00:02:05,788 --> 00:02:07,788
i.e., the clone of the rocket,

52
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:09,788
as standard instantiate returns a type

53
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:13,064
called Object. But in order to fire our rocket

54
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:16,099
we're going to change that type to a rigidbody.

55
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,662
To do this we use as RigidBody

56
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:20,816
after the instantiate call and store the

57
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:23,865
the returned value in a rigidbody variable,

58
00:02:23,865 --> 00:02:26,291
which we'll call rocketInstance.

59
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,291
So here we setup a rigidbody variable

60
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,662
called rocketInstance, and we set that 

61
00:02:30,662 --> 00:02:32,662
variable equal to our instantiate

62
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,961
function's return. Then given that this is

63
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:38,677
now a rigidbody we can use our variable

64
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:41,219
rocket instance and address anything within

65
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,893
the rigidbody class, for example addForce.

66
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,890
And again we can make use of the transform

67
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,062
barrelEnd to grab the direction

68
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:53,062
at which we want to add a force.

69
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,242
And we can multiply by a certain amount.

70
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:01,869
So now when I press play

71
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:05,802
and fire, my rockets are fired off

72
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:08,161
in to the distance by adding a force to

73
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:10,161
the clone that I create.

74
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:14,126
Bare in mind that when you create many clones

75
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:16,126
within the game those things will still

76
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:18,450
exist within your scene. So if doing

77
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,450
something like this you may want to consider

78
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,953
writing a script which removes them from

79
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:24,785
the world after a certain amount of time.

80
00:03:24,785 --> 00:03:27,646
Here my prefab has a rocket destruction script

81
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:29,646
which simply removes the object

82
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:31,646
after 1 and a half seconds.
