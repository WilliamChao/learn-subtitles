1
00:00:00,221 --> 00:00:02,465
Awake and Start are two functions that

2
00:00:02,465 --> 00:00:04,174
are called automatically when a script 

3
00:00:04,174 --> 00:00:06,644
is loaded. Awake is called first

4
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:09,311
even if the script component is not enabled

5
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:11,311
and is best used for setting up any references

6
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,756
between scripts and initialisation.

7
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:16,561
Start is called after Awake, immediately

8
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:18,561
before the first Update, but only if

9
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:20,561
the script component is enabled.

10
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:22,690
This means that you can use Start for

11
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,690
anything you need to occur when the script

12
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,089
component is enabled. 

13
00:00:26,382 --> 00:00:28,271
This allows you to delay any part of your 

14
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:31,228
initalisation code until it's really needed.

15
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:33,228
For example an enemy character could enter

16
00:00:33,228 --> 00:00:35,897
the game and use Awake to have ammo

17
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:37,897
count assigned to him, but only

18
00:00:37,897 --> 00:00:40,245
get the ability to shoot, using Start

19
00:00:40,245 --> 00:00:42,245
at a defined time when that script component

20
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:44,245
is enabled. It should be noted 

21
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:46,245
however that Start and Awake will only

22
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:48,245
ever be called once in the lifetime of

23
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:50,245
a script attached to an object.

24
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:52,245
So you cannot repeat the Start function

25
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:55,405
by disabling and re-enabling a script.

26
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,377
In this example we have a script that

27
00:00:58,377 --> 00:01:00,377
has Awake and Start functions.

28
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:04,576
We're using Debug.Log to show

29
00:01:04,576 --> 00:01:06,576
when those two things occur.

30
00:01:07,076 --> 00:01:09,076
For example without this script component

31
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:12,208
enabled we will simply see the Awake function.

32
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:21,061
But if I enable the script I will see that

33
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,061
both functions have been called.

34
00:01:27,773 --> 00:01:30,193
This is useful as it allows you to initialise

35
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:32,193
settings for an object before enabling

36
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:34,818
that script component without the need for

37
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:38,080
splitting the script in to several different scripts.
