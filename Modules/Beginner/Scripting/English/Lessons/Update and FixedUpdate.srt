1
00:00:00,249 --> 00:00:02,166
Update is probably the most commonly

2
00:00:02,166 --> 00:00:03,677
used function in Unity.

3
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:06,011
It's called once per frame on every script

4
00:00:06,011 --> 00:00:08,387
that uses it. Almost anything that needs

5
00:00:08,387 --> 00:00:11,130
to be changed or adjusted regularly happens here.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,629
The movement of non-physics objects,

7
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:15,629
simple timers and the detection of input

8
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:17,257
are just a few things that are usually

9
00:00:17,257 --> 00:00:20,178
done in update. Note that update is not

10
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:22,864
called on a regular timeline. If one frame

11
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:24,864
takes longer to process than the next

12
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:26,864
then the time between update calls will

13
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:29,221
be different. Fixed update is a similar

14
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:31,111
function to update but it has a few 

15
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:33,483
important differences. Fixed update is

16
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:35,483
called on a regular timeline and will have

17
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:37,731
the same time between calls.

18
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:40,094
Immediately after fixed update is called,

19
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:42,705
any necessary physics calculations are made.

20
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:45,136
As such anything that effects a rigidbody -

21
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:47,858
meaning a physics object, should be executed

22
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:50,316
in fixed update rather than update.

23
00:00:51,283 --> 00:00:53,602
When scripting physics in the fixed update

24
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:56,032
it's good practice to use forces for movement.

25
00:00:56,946 --> 00:00:58,261
Let's take a look at the difference

26
00:00:58,261 --> 00:01:00,709
between fixed update and update calls.

27
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:03,129
In this example we're logging to the console

28
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:06,017
with each fixed update and update by adding

29
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:08,017
the value of Time.deltaTime.

30
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,723
When I press play

31
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:13,152
and pause

32
00:01:13,652 --> 00:01:15,374
you can see that the time between fixed

33
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:18,770
updates is always 0.02.

34
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,990
where the time between updates varies.

35
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:24,364
This can be shown even more clearly by

36
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:26,364
collapsing the console.

37
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:29,531
If I play now and pause

38
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:31,364
you can see that all of my fixed updates

39
00:01:31,364 --> 00:01:33,952
are collapsed in to one. There's been 111

40
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,164
of them and they're all 0.02.

41
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,164
Whereas the update times vary.
