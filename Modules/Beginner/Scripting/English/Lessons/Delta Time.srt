1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,548
The term Delta means a difference between

2
00:00:02,548 --> 00:00:05,655
two values. The deltaTime property of the 

3
00:00:05,655 --> 00:00:07,655
time class is essentially the time

4
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:10,117
between each update or fixed update

5
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:13,051
function call. This can be used to smooth out

6
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:15,051
values used for movement and other

7
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:17,051
incremental calculations.

8
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,551
The time between frames is not constant.

9
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:21,551
So if, for example, you're moving an

10
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:23,914
object in each frame by a fixed amount

11
00:00:23,914 --> 00:00:26,607
then the overall effect might not be smooth.

12
00:00:27,107 --> 00:00:28,954
This is because the amount of time it takes 

13
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:30,954
to complete a frame will vary,

14
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:32,719
despite the distance of movement 

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,246
remaining constant. If you modify the change

16
00:00:35,246 --> 00:00:38,010
using time.deltaTime then any frames that

17
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,865
take a longer time will see a bigger change.

18
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:43,115
And any frames that take a shorter time

19
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:45,115
will see a smaller change.

20
00:00:45,115 --> 00:00:47,115
The overall effect of this is that over a period

21
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:49,847
of time the change will appear smooth

22
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:51,847
as is shown in this demonstration.

23
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:55,645
Let's see this in action. When the scene

24
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:58,394
starts our countdown variable is reduced

25
00:00:58,394 --> 00:01:00,394
by the amount of time, in seconds, 

26
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,394
that it takes to complete each frame.

27
00:01:02,784 --> 00:01:05,298
And when this reaches 0 we are enabling a 

28
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:08,611
light component on our power cube game object.

29
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,357
At the same time we can control the cube

30
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:22,282
movement. Here we are modifying the X axis

31
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,282
of the object when the right arrow

32
00:01:24,282 --> 00:01:26,282
key is pressed by adding an amount

33
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:28,282
defined by the variable 'speed'

34
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:31,113
and modified by Time.deltaTime.

35
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:33,113
The movement is smoothed so that the speed

36
00:01:33,113 --> 00:01:35,113
remains constant, even if the frame rate

37
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:37,567
varies. The effect of using Time.deltaTime

38
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:39,567
in this way is that it gives

39
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,567
a change in values per second

40
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,567
rather than per frame.
