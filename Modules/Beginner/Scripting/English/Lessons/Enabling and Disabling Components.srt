00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:03,116
To enable or disable a component in Unity

2
00:00:03,116 --> 00:00:05,116
simply use the Enabled flag.

3
00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:07,395
In this example we have a reference

4
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:09,797
to a light, called myLight

5
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:12,476
and in Start we're setting this variable

6
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:14,476
using the GetComponent function

7
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:17,098
to the light component attached to our object.

8
00:00:17,764 --> 00:00:20,820
In update I'm waiting for the key press space

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,958
and then I'm setting the Enabled flag

10
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,546
on myLight to false.

11
00:00:25,237 --> 00:00:27,237
Let's see it in action.

12
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:33,562
I could also set this to true, but it

13
00:00:33,562 --> 00:00:34,967
would be even more efficient to make

14
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:36,967
it a toggle. So I'll set it to

15
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:39,945
the inverse of myLight.enabled.

16
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:42,476
So by using the exclamation mark

17
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:45,138
not keyword I'm effectively saying

18
00:00:45,138 --> 00:00:47,414
set this to whatever it's not at the moment.

19
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:49,383
So I'll save my script.

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,699
And now you can see that when I press play

21
00:00:55,746 --> 00:00:57,746
the spacebar acts as a toggle

22
00:00:57,746 --> 00:01:00,022
switching the light component on and off

23
00:01:00,022 --> 00:01:02,450
signified by the checking and unchecking

24
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,450
of the checkbox next to the name of

25
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,978
the component in the inspector. 

26
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:07,978
Keep in mind that because scripts are also

27
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:10,325
components you can use the dot enabled

28
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:12,697
flag to disable those too.
