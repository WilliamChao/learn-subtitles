1
00:00:00,331 --> 00:00:01,926
To activate or deactivate an object

2
00:00:01,926 --> 00:00:04,228
via scripting you can use the

3
00:00:04,228 --> 00:00:05,783
SetActive function.

4
00:00:06,283 --> 00:00:08,005
This will switch your object on or off

5
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:10,491
in terms of it being active in the scene.

6
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:12,781
In this example we have a simple Start

7
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:14,106
function that contains 

8
00:00:14,106 --> 00:00:16,527
gameObject.SetActive(false).

9
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:19,027
And you can see that my gameobject

10
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:20,496
is currently active.

11
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:24,523
If I press play, the object is deactivated.

12
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:26,803
However when working with hierarchies of 

13
00:00:26,803 --> 00:00:28,803
objects, it's important to know that

14
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:30,803
a parent object can be deactivated,

15
00:00:30,803 --> 00:00:32,803
which will stop a child object being active

16
00:00:32,803 --> 00:00:36,025
in the scene. However it will remain active

17
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:37,622
within it's hierarchy.

18
00:00:38,152 --> 00:00:39,886
This is so that you can disable individual

19
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:42,676
objects but maintain control over groups

20
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:44,676
of them using the parent object.

21
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:46,676
You can see here that if I select the Physics

22
00:00:46,676 --> 00:00:49,944
door and select the child Door Object

23
00:00:49,944 --> 00:00:51,944
and deactivate it in the inspector

24
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:54,540
it becomes deselected, the icon is greyed

25
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,711
out and I've unchecked the box next to it's name.

26
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:00,211
However if I deactivate the parent object

27
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:03,373
instead of the child you can see that I've

28
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:06,320
deactivated all of the child objects but 

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,764
it remains active within the hierarchy,

30
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:11,264
as does the other child object, the frame.

31
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:13,764
To check if an object is active within

32
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:15,764
the scene or in a hierarchy,

33
00:01:15,764 --> 00:01:17,152
you can query using the using the

34
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:20,181
activeSelf and activeInHierarchy states.

35
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:22,768
In this 'check states' script I have a public

36
00:01:22,768 --> 00:01:25,335
variable for a gameobject and I'm checking

37
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,335
that gameobject as to whether it's

38
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:29,251
active self or active in the Hierarchy.

39
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,012
We're referring to the physics door we

40
00:01:32,012 --> 00:01:35,226
mentioned previously and debug logging

41
00:01:35,226 --> 00:01:37,226
the state of those to the console. 

42
00:01:37,726 --> 00:01:39,726
So when I press play

43
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,234
the door itself is active

44
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:45,234
and the hierarchy that it's in is 

45
00:01:45,234 --> 00:01:48,218
also active. However, if I deactivate the 

46
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:50,877
parent and press play again,

47
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,334
the door itself is active but the hierarchy

48
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:56,334
that it's in is not active

49
00:01:56,334 --> 00:01:58,334
because the parent is deactivated,

50
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:01,270
and is therefore not active in the scene.

51
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,270
It should also be noted that when a child

52
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,201
object is inactive because it's 

53
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:07,201
parent is inactive using setActive

54
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,561
to true will not make that child object

55
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:12,467
active. It can only become active again

56
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,745
once it's parent is made active.
