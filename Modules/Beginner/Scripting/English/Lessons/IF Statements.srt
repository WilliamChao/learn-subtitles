00:00:00,373 --> 00:00:02,409
Often in coding you will need your code to

2
00:00:02,409 --> 00:00:04,862
make a decision based on a condition.

3
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:07,542
Think of having a cup of coffee.

4
00:00:07,876 --> 00:00:09,876
When it's first made the water is boiling.

5
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:12,376
You might want to check if it's ready to drink.

6
00:00:13,498 --> 00:00:15,498
If the coffee's temperature is greater the

7
00:00:15,498 --> 00:00:16,916
hottest temperature you're willing to

8
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,916
drink it at then you won't drink it.

9
00:00:19,982 --> 00:00:21,982
An extension of the if statement is 

10
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:23,716
the if-else statement.

11
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:26,238
In our coffee example the else statement

12
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:28,238
might be that you drink the coffee.

13
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:30,738
This action will not be executed when the

14
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:32,738
first condition is not satisfied.

15
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:34,738
So if the coffee is not too hot to drink

16
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:36,738
then we drink it.

17
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:39,915
This can be further extended by making

18
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,915
the else statement a conditional

19
00:00:41,915 --> 00:00:43,638
by using another 'if'.

20
00:00:44,138 --> 00:00:46,138
With our coffee example, if the coffee

21
00:00:46,138 --> 00:00:48,138
was too hot we wouldn't drink it,

22
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:50,138
but if we'd left it too long, and if

23
00:00:50,138 --> 00:00:52,138
it had gotten cold then we might not

24
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:53,201
drink it either.

25
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:55,701
However if neither of these conditions

26
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:57,993
are satisfied, that is, that the

27
00:00:57,993 --> 00:00:59,993
coffee is neither too hot nor too cold

28
00:01:00,396 --> 00:01:02,049
then the coffee is at an appropriate

29
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:04,049
drinking temperature. Let's take a look

30
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,049
at this in action.

31
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:14,391
Now that it's dropped below my hot limit

32
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:16,885
the coffee is just right.

33
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:19,567
But if I wait until it's below the cold limit

34
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:21,736
the coffee's too cold.

35
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,208
So you can use 'if' statements in this way to make

36
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,001
decisions within your code as to

37
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:26,913
what it should do.
