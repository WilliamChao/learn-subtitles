00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:02,962
In Unity GetKey or GetButton are ways

2
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:04,962
of receiving input from keys or joystick

3
00:00:04,962 --> 00:00:07,487
buttons via Unity's input class.

4
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:09,987
The core differences between the two is

5
00:00:09,987 --> 00:00:12,359
that GetKey specifically names keys for you

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:15,823
using key codes. For example, the Spacebar

7
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:18,657
is represented by KeyCode.Space

8
00:00:19,157 --> 00:00:21,406
This works just fine for keyboard but it's

9
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:23,766
recommended that you use GetButton instead

10
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:26,098
and specify your own controls.

11
00:00:26,763 --> 00:00:28,763
The input manager gives you the ability to

12
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:31,939
name an input and specify a key or button for it

13
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:33,618
and can be accessed by choosing

14
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:38,247
Edit - Project Settings - Input

15
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:39,529
from the top menu.

16
00:00:40,029 --> 00:00:42,178
Then, when calling it, you can reference 

17
00:00:42,178 --> 00:00:43,955
a name using a string.

18
00:00:44,206 --> 00:00:45,656
For example, Jump.

19
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,963
This is a default input represented by

20
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:50,311
the Spacebar, but we could put in a

21
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:52,115
different key or button code in order to

22
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:54,407
change the input that represents Jump.

23
00:00:54,698 --> 00:00:56,698
Then when calling this button you can

24
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:58,698
reference the name using the string Jump.

25
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,687
To find out what to write in to your

26
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:02,971
positive button check the reference in the

27
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:04,971
documentation or look at the table

28
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:06,225
that accompanies this lesson.

29
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:09,745
When using GetKey or GetButton these inputs

30
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:12,199
have three states that return a Boolean.

31
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:16,523
True or false. First is GetKey or GetButton.

32
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:18,523
This will register true or false

33
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:20,523
depending on whether the button is being pressed

34
00:01:20,523 --> 00:01:23,077
or not. So currently the key is not

35
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:26,735
being pressed so GetButton is returning false.

36
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:28,735
When we first press the key it then

37
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:30,735
returns true on the first frame,

38
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:33,235
then as we progress through frames,

39
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,886
holding down the button GetButtonDown

40
00:01:36,886 --> 00:01:40,479
returns to false. GetButton still equals true

41
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,840
so we can check if the button is being held.

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,689
Then when we release the button GetButtonUp

43
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,306
shows true, but only again on the first frame.

44
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:52,654
As we continue, all values return to false.

45
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,654
So let's run through that again.

46
00:01:54,654 --> 00:01:56,654
When the button is not being touched

47
00:01:56,654 --> 00:01:58,654
everything is false.

48
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:01,154
When we first press the button we can

49
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,709
check for this using GetButtonDown,

50
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:06,398
which will return true. Also GetButton

51
00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:09,185
will return true. After the first frame

52
00:02:09,185 --> 00:02:11,185
GetButtonDown returns to false

53
00:02:11,185 --> 00:02:13,185
so you can use this for tasks like

54
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:15,576
firing a weapon once. Then as we continue

55
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:17,852
to hold down only GetButton will return true.

56
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:20,420
Then when we release GetButtonUp

57
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,011
returns true for a single frame and then

58
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:25,427
thereafter returns back to false.

59
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,080
You should note that GetKey behaves

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,412
exactly the same way.

61
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:32,938
Only that the code is written slightly differently.

62
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:35,438
In order to check for a button

63
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:38,713
we use the string of the title that was placed

64
00:02:38,713 --> 00:02:40,713
in the input manager, Jump.

65
00:02:41,213 --> 00:02:43,213
But when checking for a very specific key

66
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:45,006
we can use KeyCodes.

67
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:47,839
Because this only pertains to the exact key

68
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:49,839
it's recommended that you use GetButton

69
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:52,508
and specify the inputs using the input manager

70
00:02:52,508 --> 00:02:54,080
as shown earlier.
