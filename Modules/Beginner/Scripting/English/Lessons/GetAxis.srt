1
00:00:00,249 --> 00:00:03,080
Input.GetAxis works in a similar fashion

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,080
to GetButton and GetKey

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,080
but with some fundamental differences.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,240
GetKey and GetButton both return a bool,

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,502
the button is either pressed or not pressed.

6
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:15,085
Whilst GetAxis returns a float value

7
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:17,085
between -1 and positive 1.

8
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:19,910
We setup axes in the input manager,

9
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,765
which can be accessed via the

10
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:26,672
Edit - Project Settings - Input top menu.

11
00:00:27,172 --> 00:00:29,711
With a button press you'd only consider 

12
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:31,711
the positive button value.

13
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:34,542
But with an axis we should consider

14
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:36,960
the both positive and negative buttons.

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,772
As well as gravity, sensitivity, 

16
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:41,772
dead and snap.

17
00:00:42,673 --> 00:00:44,426
This is the standard behaviour of

18
00:00:44,426 --> 00:00:46,426
GetAxis Horizontal.

19
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,453
Remember that GetAxis returns a float,

20
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:54,534
as such it is a sliding scale between -1

21
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:57,086
and 1. The gravity of the axis

22
00:00:57,086 --> 00:00:59,802
affects how fast this scale returns to 0

23
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:01,802
after the button has been released.

24
00:01:01,802 --> 00:01:03,998
The higher the gravity, the faster the return

25
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:07,339
so if we increase the gravity from 3 to 100

26
00:01:07,687 --> 00:01:11,207
we will see this axis returns to 0 more quickly.

27
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:17,918
Likewise if we lower the value from the

28
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:20,729
default of 3 to 0.1 the axis

29
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,403
value will return to 0 more slowly.

30
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:30,739
Sensitivity is the opposite of gravity

31
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:32,739
and controls how quickly the return value

32
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:35,753
of the input reaches 1 or -1.

33
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:39,045
The higher the number the more responsive,

34
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:41,601
the lower the number the more smooth.

35
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:04,427
If we were using a joystick to represent

36
00:02:04,427 --> 00:02:07,444
our axis then we wouldn't necessarily want to

37
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:09,444
to feel an effect from very small amounts

38
00:02:09,444 --> 00:02:10,619
of joystick movement.

39
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,837
To avoid this we have a dead zone.

40
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:15,615
The higher the dead value is the larger

41
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:17,945
the dead zone and the further the joystick

42
00:02:17,945 --> 00:02:19,945
must be moved in order for GetAxis to

43
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:21,593
return a non 0 value.

44
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:23,911
The snap option allows you to return

45
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:27,347
0 if both positive and negative buttons are held.

46
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:30,321
To receive a value from horizontal or 

47
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:33,222
vertical axis simply add an instance of

48
00:02:33,222 --> 00:02:36,056
Input.GetAxis(''Horizontal'')

49
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:38,384
or Input.GetAxis(''Vertical'')

50
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:40,384
to your code as seen here.

51
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:47,366
You can also use Input.GetAxisRaw

52
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:49,087
to only return whole numbers

53
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,087
and nothing in between. This is useful

54
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,394
for 2D games that need precise control

55
00:02:53,394 --> 00:02:55,394
rather than smoothed values.

56
00:02:55,394 --> 00:02:57,394
Note that this does not require the use

57
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:59,394
of gravity or sensitivity.
