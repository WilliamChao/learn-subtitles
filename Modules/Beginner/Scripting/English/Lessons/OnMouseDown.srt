1
00:00:00,249 --> 00:00:02,928
OnMouseDown and its related functions

2
00:00:02,928 --> 00:00:04,928
can detect a click on a collider

3
00:00:04,928 --> 00:00:06,692
or a GUI text element.

4
00:00:07,192 --> 00:00:09,192
In this example we have a door object

5
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:12,696
that has a box collider and a rigidbody attached.

6
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:15,887
The script that I've written

7
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:18,484
has an OnMouseDown function

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,150
and when that object is clicked

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,248
we will Debug Log, meaning that we'll print to the console,

10
00:00:24,248 --> 00:00:26,248
''Clicked On The Door''.

11
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:30,184
So when I press play.

12
00:00:31,554 --> 00:00:34,461
check my console and click on the door in the game

13
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:36,961
I get a Debug Log.

14
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,337
Similarly we can make it do something more

15
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:43,341
exciting. For example, adding a force

16
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:45,703
to the door object when it is clicked.

17
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:47,703
So in this example I am adding a force

18
00:00:48,203 --> 00:00:51,247
in the inverse direction of its forward.

19
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:56,455
So the door will be fired away

20
00:00:56,455 --> 00:00:58,110
from it's Z axis.

21
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:01,278
And I am also switching on gravity

22
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:03,681
so that it will fall down when it's clicked.

23
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:05,985
It looks like this.
