1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,141
The Destroy function can be used to remove

2
00:00:02,141 --> 00:00:04,141
gameobjects or components from

3
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:05,708
gameobjects at runtime.

4
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:08,469
This can also be done with a time delay

5
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:11,442
by using it's second argument, a float number.

6
00:00:11,942 --> 00:00:13,942
To destroy a gameobject, for example, 

7
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:15,942
we could simply refer to the gameobject

8
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:17,612
that the script is attached to.

9
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:20,663
In this example our prop samoflange object

10
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:22,663
has the script attached to it, and when the

11
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:24,815
spacebar is pressed the gameobject

12
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:26,815
will be destroyed.

13
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:31,345
Now a problem could be that you may be using

14
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:33,345
this script for various purposes

15
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:35,983
so it doesn't make sense to destroy the object

16
00:00:35,983 --> 00:00:37,983
as the script component will be removed

17
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:39,983
too, as it's attached to the object.

18
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:42,696
So instead you'd likely use a reference

19
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:45,581
to another object. Here we've setup a public

20
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:47,581
variable called Other to refer 

21
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:51,147
to another object. Then in the inspector

22
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:53,703
we'll drag on another object to use,

23
00:00:53,703 --> 00:00:55,703
for example our physics door.

24
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:00,233
Now when we press play

25
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,733
and press space

26
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:05,233
our door gets removed from the scene.

27
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:08,962
You can also use the Destroy command to remove

28
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:12,065
components, rather than entire game objects.

29
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:14,580
For this we use the GetComponent function

30
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,580
inside the destroy parenthesis

31
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,359
to refer to a component.

32
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,873
In this example I'll destroy the mesh

33
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,873
renderer component so that the object

34
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:24,873
is no longer visibly rendered.

35
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:30,328
Here you can see that the object is still

36
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:33,095
in the game and has all of it's other

37
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:34,859
components, except for the mesh renderer

38
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:37,632
that we removed. All of these examples can

39
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:40,203
include a number as the second argument

40
00:01:40,203 --> 00:01:42,203
in order to create a timed delay.

41
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,829
For example, if I add 3 as a floating

42
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:48,394
point number, as my second argument,

43
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:50,208
save the script.

44
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:54,886
Once I've pressed the spacebar

45
00:01:56,422 --> 00:01:58,422
there will be a 3 second delay

46
00:01:58,922 --> 00:02:00,922
and then my object will be removed.

47
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:04,002
This works the same for destroying components.
