1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,293
LookAt can be used to make a gameobject's

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,083
forward direction point at another 

3
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:06,609
transform in the world. In this example

4
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:08,678
our samoflange prop is falling and

5
00:00:08,678 --> 00:00:10,678
bouncing off of our hoverpad.

6
00:00:14,203 --> 00:00:16,203
Our camera is pointing at the hoverpad,

7
00:00:16,203 --> 00:00:17,995
as you can see in the game view.

8
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:19,637
But what if we want to make it look at the

9
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:21,817
falling object? We can use the LookAt

10
00:00:21,817 --> 00:00:23,817
function inside of update in order to

11
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:26,219
achieve this. In this script you can see

12
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:27,843
that we make a reference to the object

13
00:00:27,843 --> 00:00:29,481
that we wish to look for.

14
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:33,371
A variable called 'target' of type transform.

15
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:35,909
We then use the transform.LookAt function

16
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:38,493
to tell our object to look at the target.

17
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:41,818
Now we'll simply apply this to our camera

18
00:00:41,818 --> 00:00:44,890
and drag on the prop samoflange object

19
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,890
as the object to track.

20
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:50,343
Now when I press play

21
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:56,291
our camera is constantly facing the object.

22
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,667
Remember that you can toggle between global

23
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:01,275
and local axis representation at the top

24
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:02,771
of the interface.

25
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,013
This is with global, and if I toggle to local

26
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:09,724
you can see my forward direction is 

27
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:12,003
facing the object.
