00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,708
In this video we will show you how to prepare your

2
00:00:02,708 --> 00:00:05,861
iOS application on iTunes Connect for publishing.

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,516
Open Manage Your Applications.

4
00:00:08,787 --> 00:00:12,777
In there you will see all your mobile and standalone applications.

5
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:15,949
Let's start and add a new application by clicking

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,029
Add New App.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,367
Here you will need to select iOS or OS X Application.

8
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:23,173
Select iOS.

9
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,458
Here you will need to write your primary

10
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,789
information about your app.

11
00:00:27,163 --> 00:00:30,071
Write the app name, this is the title of your game or app.

12
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:32,313
Enter the SKU number.

13
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:34,929
Select a bundle ID, which you've created in your

14
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:37,191
Developer.Apple.Com account.

15
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:39,355
Enter the bundle ID suffix,

16
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:41,355
which should be named the same as you entered

17
00:00:41,355 --> 00:00:45,394
in your iOS Player Settings bundle identifier in Unity.

18
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,094
After you finish, click continue.

19
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:52,824
In this step select your application availability date and price.

20
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:54,002
Select continue.

21
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,947
In this step we will need to write all the details about the application,

22
00:00:57,947 --> 00:00:59,605
enter the version number.

23
00:00:59,605 --> 00:01:01,917
It should be exactly as you wrote in Unity's

24
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:03,917
iOS Player Settings Version.

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,438
Enter the copyright,

26
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:09,450
it's your company, studio or team name.

27
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:13,643
Select the primary category and sub-category.

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,510
Select a secondary category if required.

29
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:20,376
Next go through the rating system.

30
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:25,634
Next meta data, enter a short description of your game.

31
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:27,833
Enter search keywords by which your game

32
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,360
will be found on the store.

33
00:01:30,554 --> 00:01:34,196
Enter a support URL or other information if required.

34
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:37,118
In contact information enter your

35
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,256
first and last names, an email address and a phone number.

36
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:42,667
Don't worry about these optional fields now,

37
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:44,667
you can enter them later if required.

38
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,232
Regarding uploads, the minimum requirements

39
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,695
are to upload an icon of 1024 pixels squared

40
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:52,695
and one of any of your screen shots.

41
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:55,399
The rest of the screen shots you can upload later.

42
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,944
Screen shots should match the screen size that you've chosen.

43
00:01:59,716 --> 00:02:02,342
And the upload quality should be as good as possible.

44
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:04,938
After you finish click save.

45
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:10,242
If everything that you wrote and selected is correct,

46
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:12,715
you will see your application status is now

47
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,126
'Prepared For Upload'.

48
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:16,263
If you go back to Manage Your Apps

49
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:18,709
you will see that your application is now in the list.

50
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:21,723
If you want to add more details, or change something,

51
00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:24,458
you can click on your app, select View Details

52
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,662
and change the majority of the information.

53
00:02:26,662 --> 00:02:28,009
You can change that any time

54
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:30,779
so don't worry if you're not sure if you wrote everything correctly.

55
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:34,022
If everything is okay and you're ready to upload the game binary

56
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:36,227
click on Ready To Upload Binary.

57
00:02:36,227 --> 00:02:39,117
Answer Yes or No to the question about encryption,

58
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,117
click Save and then Continue.

59
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:44,118
You will now see that your application has changed status

60
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:47,098
from Ready To Upload to Waiting For Upload.

61
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:50,614
That means that the application preparation part is done.

62
00:02:50,614 --> 00:02:53,324
You can now upload your binary through Xcode

63
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:55,121
and we'll cover how to do that next.

64
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:57,109
Now that you've prepared your application on

65
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:59,444
iTunes Connect for upload it's time to prepare your

66
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:02,571
application and content in Unity and send it to Xcode.

67
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:04,571
Open the build settings in the editor.

68
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,424
Go to File - Build Settings.

69
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:09,025
Make sure that the iOS platform is selected

70
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:11,025
and make sure that your scenes are included.

71
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,775
Click on player settings and check if

72
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:17,274
in Cross Platform settings you wrote Company Name.

73
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:19,253
It should be your company name as you wrote

74
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:20,274
in iTunes Connect.

75
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:22,921
Check also that you've written the product name,

76
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:26,400
this will be the exact name of your application label on the device.

77
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:29,589
Check that the default icon is selected.

78
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:34,590
In resolution and presentation that the default resolution is correct,

79
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,961
and the status bar is correct for you.

80
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:41,172
In icon, the 'All Icons' will be selected as your default icon.

81
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,243
If you want to override a specific icon for a specific resolution

82
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:48,354
you can change it by checking Override For iPhone.

83
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,473
In Splash Image check that you have added

84
00:03:51,473 --> 00:03:52,975
all required splash screens.

85
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:55,885
If you application is only for iPhone or iPad

86
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:57,385
you can only add them.

87
00:03:57,385 --> 00:03:59,199
Otherwise you will need to add all of them.

88
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,033
In Other Settings check if your bundle identifier

89
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,556
is named exactly as it is in iTunes Connect.

90
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:06,556
It has to be 100% exact.

91
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:08,556
This is also true for bundle version.

92
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:10,556
Check all other important settings like

93
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:13,649
Target Device, SDK version and Stripping Level.

94
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:15,297
When your Player Settings are setup

95
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,811
go back to Build Settings.

96
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:20,057
Check if Sym Link Unity Libraries and Development Build

97
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:20,687
is checked.

98
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:22,265
If not, click build.

99
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:25,307
Give a name for your Xcode project and click save.

100
00:04:25,952 --> 00:04:27,655
Wait for it to finish compiling.

101
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:30,145
When it finishes Unity will open a Finder window

102
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,145
and your Xcode project will appear.

103
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:35,284
In the next part we will show you how to proceed

104
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:36,484
with uploading your application from

105
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,484
Xcode to iTunes Connect.

106
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:41,051
In this final part we will show you how to

107
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:43,459
submit your Unity application from Xcode.

108
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:45,459
Once you've built your application from Unity

109
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,459
open the Xcode project.

110
00:04:48,378 --> 00:04:51,359
When Xcode launches, clean the project by going to

111
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,626
Product - Clean.

112
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,901
Select Issue Navigator, the triangle with the

113
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:58,470
exclamatory mark inside, and select your project.

114
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,072
In the Summary tab check if all the settings

115
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:02,837
are set correctly from Unity.

116
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:05,073
In Build Settings tab you will need to change

117
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:08,044
your code signing from Developer to Distribution.

118
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:10,262
Before that we suggest you run your application

119
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:12,440
one more time on the device to double check

120
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,668
that everything's okay.

121
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:16,120
When you change code signing to distribution

122
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,120
perform Clean one more time.

123
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:21,666
Then build for archiving by clicking

124
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,792
Product - Build For - Archiving.

125
00:05:25,516 --> 00:05:28,046
It will build your application for distribution.

126
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:30,046
Then you will need to archive it by clicking

127
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:31,551
Product - Archive.

128
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:32,924
Wait for it to finish

129
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:35,835
and after archiving is successful Xcode will

130
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,835
open the organiser automatically.

131
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:40,757
In the organise click Distribute.

132
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:42,755
Click Next.

133
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:46,479
Put your login information and click Next again.

134
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:49,831
Choose your application which is on iTunes Connect.

135
00:05:49,831 --> 00:05:53,098
Select code signing identity and click Next.

136
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:55,294
Now Xcode will check your application binary

137
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:56,333
for any mistakes.

138
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,680
Splash screens, icon, SDK, targets etcetera.

139
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,408
It might take a few minutes.

140
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:03,584
When it finishes checking it should say

141
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:05,584
'no issues were found in your application'.

142
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:08,917
Now open the iTunes Connect page and refresh the page.

143
00:06:09,406 --> 00:06:12,990
You will see that your application status is now Upload Received.

144
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,723
iTunes Connect might ask you for some more information

145
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:18,495
like Add All Necessary Screen Shots or similar.

146
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:21,749
But now you are done and you should see your status change to

147
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,302
Waiting For Review pretty soon.

148
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:27,008
Then finally In Review, which may take 1 to 2 weeks.

149
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:30,224
If everything is okay your application will be submitted

150
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,969
to the app store.
